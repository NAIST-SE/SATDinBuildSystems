If\n      the directory does not match the enhanced class' package, the package\n      structure will be created beneath the directory. By default, the\n      enhancer overwrites the original .class file.\n    * -enforcePropertyRestrictions/-epr <true/t | false/f>: Whether to\n      throw an exception when it appears that a property access entity is\n      not obeying the restrictions placed on property access. Defaults to\n      false.\n    * -addDefaultConstructor/-adc <true/t | false/f>: The spec requires\n      that all persistent classes define a no-arg constructor. This flag\n      tells the enhancer whether to add a protected no-arg constructor to\n      any persistent classes that don't already have one. Defaults to true.\n    * -tmpClassLoader/-tcl <true/t | false/f>: Whether to load persistent\n      classes with a temporary class loader. This allows other code to then\n      load the enhanced version of the class within the same JVM. Defaults\n      to true. Try setting this flag to false as a debugging step if you\n      run into class loading problems when running the enhancer.\n\nEach additional argument to the enhancer must be one of the following:\n    * The full name of a class.\n    * The .java file for a class.\n    * The .class file of a class.\n\nIf you do not supply any arguments to the enhancer, it will run on the -\n     - classes in your persistent class list (see Section 1, “Persistent\n     Class List”).\n\nYou can run the enhancer over classes that have already been enhanced, in -\n     - which case it will not further modify the class. You can also run\n     it over classes that are not persistence-capable, in which case it\n     will treat the class as persistence-aware. Persistence-aware classes\n     can directly manipulate the persistent fields of persistence-capable\n     classes.\n\nNote that the enhancement process for subclasses introduces dependencies on -\n     - the persistent parent class being enhanced. This is normally not\n     problematic; however, when running the enhancer multiple times over a\n     subclass whose parent class is not yet enhanced, class loading errors\n     can occur. In the event of a class load error, simply re-compile and\n     re-enhance the offending classes.\n",

These targets are usually executed \n    before and after some main targets. They are: \n\n      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties\n      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties\n      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation\n      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation\n      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file\n      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file\n      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test\n      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test\n      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building\n      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building\n      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products\n\n    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)\n\n    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"-post-compile\">\n            <obfuscate>\n                <fileset dir=\"${build.classes.dir}\"/>\n            </obfuscate>\n        </target>\n\n    For list of available properties check the imported \n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n\n    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.\n    The targets of interest are: \n\n      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation\n      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution\n      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging\n      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution\n      -do-jar-with-manifest:    JAR building (if you are using a manifest)\n      -do-jar-without-manifest: JAR building (if you are not using a manifest)\n      run:                      execution of project \n      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation\n      test-report:              JUnit report generation\n\n    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"run\" depends=\"NSN-impl.jar\">\n            <exec dir=\"bin\" executable=\"launcher.exe\">\n                <arg file=\"${dist.jar}\"/>\n            </exec>\n        </target>\n\n    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on \n    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available \n    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the\n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n    ",
