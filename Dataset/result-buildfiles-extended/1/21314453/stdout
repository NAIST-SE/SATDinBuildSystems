        "Text" : "\n This is the main build file for the complete langtools repository.\n It is used when building JDK (in which case it is invoked from the\n Makefile), and it can be used when working on the tools themselves,\n in an IDE such as NetBeans.\n\n External dependencies are specified via properties. These can be given\n on the command line, or by providing a local build.properties file.\n (They can also be edited into make/build.properties, although that is not\n recommended.)  At a minimum, boot.java.home must be set to the installed\n location of the version of JDK used to build this repository. Additional\n properties may be required, depending on the targets that are built.\n For example, to run any of the jtreg tests you must set jtreg.home,\n to run findbugs on the code you must set findbugs.home, and so on.\n\n For the most part, javac can be built using the previous version of JDK.\n However, a small number of javac files require access to the latest JDK,\n which may not yet have been compiled. To compile these files, you can do\n one of the following:\n - Set boot.java.home to a recent build of the latest version of JDK.\n - Set import.jdk to either a recent build (containing jre/lib/rt.jar)\n   or to jdk source repository.  In the latter case, stub files will\n   automatically be generated and used for the required API, to avoid\n   unnecessary compilation of the source repository.\n If you do neither, the relevant files will not be built.\n\n The main build happens in two phases:\n - First, javac and other tools as needed are built using ${boot.java.home}.\n   (This implies a constraint on the source code that they can be compiled\n   with the previous version of JDK.\n - Second, all required classes are compiled with the latest javac, created\n   in the previous step.\n The first phase is called the bootstrap phase. All targets, properties and\n tasks that are specific to that phase have \"bootstrap\" in their name.\n\n For more details on the JDK build, see\n    http://blogs.sun.com/kto/entry/anatomy_of_the_jdk_build\n    http://openjdk.java.net/groups/build/\n For more details on the stub generator, see\n    http://blogs.sun.com/jjg/entry/building_javac_for_jdk7\n\n Internal details ...\n\n Interim build products are created in the build/ directory.\n Final build products are created in the dist/ directory.\n When building JDK, the dist/directory will contain:\n - A bootstrap compiler suitable for running with ${boot.java.home}\n   suitable for compiling downstream parts of JDK\n - Source files and class files for inclusion in the JDK being built\n When building standalone, the dist/directory will contain:\n - Separate jar files for each of the separate langtools components\n - Simple scripts to invoke the tools by executing the corresponding\n   jar files.\n These jar files and scripts are \"for developer use only\".\n\n This file is organized into sections as follows:\n - global property definitions\n - general top level targets\n - general diagnostic/debugging targets\n - groups of targets for each tool: javac, javadoc, doclets, javah, javap\n    Within each group, the following targets are provided, where applicable\n      build-bootstrap-TOOL      build the bootstrap version of the tool\n      build-classes-TOOL        build the classes for the tool\n      build-TOOL                build the jar file and script for the tool\n      jtreg-TOOL                build the tool and run the appropriate tests\n      findbugs-TOOL             run findbugs on the tool's source code\n      TOOL                      build the tool, run the tests, and run findbugs\n - utility definitions\n ",

These can be given\n on the command line, or by providing a local build.properties file.\n (They can also be edited into make/build.properties, although that is not\n recommended.)  At a minimum, boot.java.home must be set to the installed\n location of the version of JDK used to build this repository. Additional\n properties may be required, depending on the targets that are built.\n For example, to run any of the jtreg tests you must set jtreg.home,\n to run findbugs on the code you must set findbugs.home, and so on.\n\n For the most part, javac can be built using the previous version of JDK.\n However, a small number of javac files require access to the latest JDK,\n which may not yet have been compiled. To compile these files, you can do\n one of the following:\n - Set boot.java.home to a recent build of the latest version of JDK.\n - Set import.jdk to either a recent build (containing jre/lib/rt.jar)\n   or to jdk source repository.  In the latter case, stub files will\n   automatically be generated and used for the required API, to avoid\n   unnecessary compilation of the source repository.\n If you do neither, the relevant files will not be built.\n\n The main build happens in two phases:\n - First, javac and other tools as needed are built using ${boot.java.home}.\n   (This implies a constraint on the source code that they can be compiled\n   with the previous version of JDK.\n - Second, all required classes are compiled with the latest javac, created\n   in the previous step.\n The first phase is called the bootstrap phase. All targets, properties and\n tasks that are specific to that phase have \"bootstrap\" in their name.\n\n For more details on the JDK build, see\n    http://blogs.sun.com/kto/entry/anatomy_of_the_jdk_build\n    http://openjdk.java.net/groups/build/\n For more details on the stub generator, see\n    http://blogs.sun.com/jjg/entry/building_javac_for_jdk7\n\n Internal details ...\n\n Interim build products are created in the build/ directory.\n Final build products are created in the dist/ directory.\n When building JDK, the dist/directory will contain:\n - A bootstrap compiler suitable for running with ${boot.java.home}\n   suitable for compiling downstream parts of JDK\n - Source files and class files for inclusion in the JDK being built\n When building standalone, the dist/directory will contain:\n - Separate jar files for each of the separate langtools components\n - Simple scripts to invoke the tools by executing the corresponding\n   jar files.\n These jar files and scripts are \"for developer use only\".\n\n This file is organized into sections as follows:\n - global property definitions\n - general top level targets\n - general diagnostic/debugging targets\n - groups of targets for each tool: javac, javadoc, doclets, javah, javap, apt\n    Within each group, the following targets are provided, where applicable\n      build-bootstrap-TOOL      build the bootstrap version of the tool\n      build-classes-TOOL        build the classes for the tool\n      build-TOOL                build the jar file and script for the tool\n      jtreg-TOOL                build the tool and run the appropriate tests\n      findbugs-TOOL             run findbugs on the tool's source oode\n      TOOL                      build the tool, run the tests, and run findbugs\n - utility definitions\n ",
