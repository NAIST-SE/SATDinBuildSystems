To use the bundled JAXB implementation would require us to\n           implement an \"internal\" Java packaged CharacterEscapeHandler which isn't available to the javac compiler from the Maven command line\n           (although it is available within an IDE). If we wanted to stick with using Sun's JAXB implementation, we could simply add in its external\n           Maven dependency here which will override the internal JAXB implementation because it gets auto-discovered. The next paragraphs describe how.\n\n           Spring's Jaxb2Marshaller class calls JAXBContext.newInstance(jaxb2Classes) which in turn calls ContextFinder.find with the “model” classes\n           we passed in (via packages to scan). If we configure a file called \"org/finra/herd/model/xml/jaxb.properties\" that contains\n           a \"javax.xml.bind.context.factory\" property, this gets used first to select the factory class for the JAXB implementation. This is how\n           we add EclipseLink MOXy (see below).\n\n           If we didn't configure this file, the ContextFinder proceeds to try other locations and eventually finds this file (for Sun's implementation):\n           \"jaxb-impl-2.2.11.jar!/META-INF/services/javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext\" by looking on the classpath for META-INF/services/javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext.\n           This file exists in jaxb-impl-2.2.11.jar and contains the text \"com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory\" which bootstraps the external JAXB\n           implementation.\n\n           If the external context file hadn't been found (i.e. we didn't add any external JAXB dependency here), the ContextFinder would eventually try to use\n           “com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.ContextFactory” which is the JDK internal default implementation.\n\n           Since EclipseLink MOXy JAR doesn't have a JAXBContext file present and hence it doesn't get auto-discovered, we need to configure the explicit\n           \"jaxb.properties\" file.  We have configured a file called \"org/finra/herd/model/xml/jaxb.properties\" that contains a \"javax.xml.bind.context.factory\"\n           property, which is used to select the factory class for the JAXB implementation.\n         ",
