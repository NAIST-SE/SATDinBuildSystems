The default is LOWERCASE. Since 1.8.0.\n\n#\n\n# PREFIX places the generated headers in subdirectories.  This should be a\n\n# CamelCase name like ``KParts``, which will cause the CamelCase forwarding\n\n# headers to be placed in the ``KParts`` directory (e.g. ``KParts/Part``).  It\n\n# will also, for the convenience of code in the source distribution, generate\n\n# forwarding headers based on the original names (e.g. ``kparts/part.h``).  This\n\n# allows includes like ``\"#include <kparts/part.h>\"`` to be used before\n\n# installation, as long as the include_directories are set appropriately.\n\n#\n\n# OUTPUT_DIR specifies where the files will be generated; this should be within\n\n# the build directory. By default, ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` will be used.\n\n# This option can be used to avoid file conflicts.\n\n#\n\n# REQUIRED_HEADERS specifies an output variable name where all the required\n\n# headers will be appended so that they can be installed together with the\n\n# generated ones.  This is mostly intended as a convenience so that adding a new\n\n# header to a project only requires specifying the CamelCase variant in the\n\n# CMakeLists.txt file; the original variant will then be added to this\n\n# variable.\n\n#\n\n# COMMON_HEADER generates an additional convenience header which includes all\n\n# other header files.\n\n#\n\n# The RELATIVE argument indicates where the original headers can be found\n\n# relative to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.  It does not affect the generated\n\n# CamelCase forwarding files, but ecm_generate_headers() uses it when checking\n\n# that the original header exists, and to generate originally named forwarding\n\n# headers when PREFIX is set.\n\n#\n\n# To allow other parts of the source distribution (eg: tests) to use the\n\n# generated headers before installation, it may be desirable to set the\n\n# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property for the library target to output_dir.
