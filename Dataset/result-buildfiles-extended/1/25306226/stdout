You\n\n# can't use CMake/CTest 2.6.x.  If you don't have the right version, it will\n\n# tell you.\n\n#\n\n# To run this script:\n\n#\n\n# 1) First configure your directory without enabling any packages (to set the\n\n# platform-specific and site-specific options).  The CMakeCache.txt file that\n\n# is created will then be modified by the script as packages are enabled and\n\n# disabled.  NOTE: For the safest results, start with an empty build directory\n\n# (except for your configure script of course).  This seems to be needed when\n\n# switching back and forth between an 'Experimental' and 'Nightly' build for\n\n# instance.\n\n#\n\n# 2) Run the script (overriding any appropriate options) as:\n\n#\n\n#    env ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES=\"<PACKAGES>\" \\\n\n#      ctest -S $TRILINOS_HOME/cmake/ctest/experimental_build_test.cmake -VV\n\n#\n\n# where PACAKGES is the semi-colon-separated list of packages being tested\n\n# (e.g. ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES=\"Teuchos;Epetra;NOX\") and TRILINOS_HOME points back\n\n# to your home Trilinos directory.  You can take off the -VV argument if you\n\n# don't want this to be too verbose.\n\n#\n\n# There are a number of other options that you can change as\n\n# environment varibles.  See the macros SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(...)\n\n# in the file TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake.  One option that you\n\n# might want to overridde, for instance is CTEST_BUILD_NAME so that\n\n# you can insert a special name into the dashboard.\n\n#\n\n# When this script finishes running, the last package listed in\n\n# ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACAKGES will be enabled in the CMakeCache.txt file.\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: It is better to use the CMake-built make target 'experimental' to run\n\n# this script as it takes care of the details of manipulating the cache and\n\n# restoring the package enables when it is done.\n\n#\n",

If the value\n\n#     <workingDir> = TEST_NAME is given, then the working directory will be\n\n#     given the name ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<testName>.  If the directory\n\n#     <workingDir> exists before the test runs, it will be deleted and created\n\n#     again.  Therefore, if you want to preserve the contents of this\n\n#     directory between test runs you need to copy it somewhere else.\n\n#\n\n#   NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then <numProcs> is the number of processors used for MPI\n\n#     executables.

However, a test case can also be defined to pass based\n\n# on:\n\n#\n\n#   PASS_ANY\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test command 'i' will be assumed to pass reguardless\n\n#     of the return value or any other output.  This would be used when a\n\n#     command that is to follow will determine pass or fail based on output\n\n#     from this command in some way.\n\n#\n\n#   PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION \"<regex>\"\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test command 'i' will be assumed to pass if it matches\n\n#     the given regular expression.  Otherwise, it is assumed to fail.\n\n#\n\n#   PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION_ALL \"<regex1>\" \"<regex2>\" ... \"<regexn>\"\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test command 'i' will be assumed to pas if the output\n\n#     matches all of the provided regular expressions.\n\n#\n\n#   FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION \"<regex>\"\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test command 'i' will be assumed to fail if it matches\n\n#     the given regular expression.  Otherwise, it is assumed to pass.\n\n#\n\n#   STANDARD_PASS_OUTPUT\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test command 'i' will be assumed to pass if the string\n\n#     expression \"Final Result: PASSED\" is found in the ouptut for the test.\n\n#\n\n# By default, the overall test will be assumed to pass if it prints:\n\n#\n\n#  \"OVERALL FINAL RESULT: TEST PASSED\"\n\n#\n\n# However, this can be changed by setting one of the following optional arguments:\n\n#\n\n#   FINAL_PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test will be assumed to pass if the output matches\n\n#     <regex>.  Otherwise, it will be assumed to fail.\n\n#\n\n#   FINAL_FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, the test will be assumed to fail if the output matches\n\n#     <regex>.  Otherwise, it will be assumed to fail.\n\n#\n\n# NOTES:\n\n#\n\n# 1) The test can be disabled by setting the variable\n\n# ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<testName>_DISABLE=ON (perhaps in the cache).

Also,\n\n#     input file locations will need to point down a directory.\n\n#\n\n#   ARGS \"<arg1> <arg2> ...\" \"<arg3> <arg4> ...\" ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then a set of arguments can be passed in quotes.  If\n\n#     multiple groups of arguments are passed in different quoted clusters of\n\n#     arguments than a different test will be added for each set of arguments.\n\n#     In this way, many different tests can be added for a single executable\n\n#     in a single call to this function.  Each of these separate tests will be\n\n#     named ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<testName>_xy where xy = 00, 01, 02, and so on.\n\n#\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX> <postfix> <arg1> <arg2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a sequence of sets of test postfix names and\n\n#     arguments lists for defining different tests.  For example, a set of\n\n#     three different tests with argument lists can be specified as:\n\n#     \n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_0 postfix1 --arg1 --arg2=\"dummy\"\n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_1 postfix2  --arg2=\"fly\"\n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_3 postfix3  --arg2=\"bags\"\n\n#\n\n#     This will create three different test cases with the postfix names\n\n#     'postfix1', 'postfix2', and 'postfix3'.  The indexes must be consecutive\n\n#     starting a 0 and going up to (currently) 19.  The main advantages of\n\n#     using these arguments instead of just 'ARGS' are that you can give\n\n#     meaningful name to each test case and you can specify multiple arguments\n\n#     without having to quote them and you can allow long argument lists to\n\n#     span multiple lines.\n\n#\n\n#   KEYWORDS <keyword1> <keyword2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a list of keywords added to a test.  These keywords\n\n#     can then be used to select tests to be run with 'ctest'.\n\n#\n\n#   COMM [serial] [mpi]\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, selects if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI\n\n#     mode.  If the COMM argument is missing, the test will be added in both\n\n#     serial and MPI builds of the code.\n\n#\n\n#   NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the number of processes that the test will be\n\n#     defined to run on and can also result in the test being exluded all\n\n#     together based on comparison to MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS.  *** ToDo: Finish\n\n#     specification of this arugment! ***\n\n#\n\n#   HOST <host1> <host2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames where the test will be included.\n\n#     The current hostname is determined by the built-in CMake command\n\n#     SITE_NAME(...).  On Linux/Unix systems, this is typically the value\n\n#     returned by 'uname -n'.\n\n#\n\n#   XHOST <host1> <host2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames where the test will *not* be\n\n#     included.  This check is performed after the check for the hostnames in\n\n#     the 'HOST' list if it should exist.  Therefore, this list exclusion list\n\n#     overrides the 'HOST' inclusion list.\n\n#\n\n#   CATEGORIES <category1> <category2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the specific categories of the test.  Valid test\n\n#     categories include BASIC, CONTINUOUS, NIGHTLY, and PERFORMANCE.  Other\n\n#     test categories will be added as needed.  By default, the category is\n\n#     BASIC.  When the CATEGORIES is BASIC it will match\n\n#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES equal to CONTINUOUS and NIGHTLY.  When\n\n#     the CATEGORIES is CONTINUOUS it will match\n\n#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES equal to CONTINUOUS and NIGHTLY.  When\n\n#     the CATEGORIES is PERFORMANCE it will match\n\n#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES=PERFORMANCE ony.\n\n#\n\n#   HOSTTYPE <hosttype1> <hosttype2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the names of the host system type (given by\n\n#     ${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}) to include the test.  Typical host system\n\n#     type names include 'Linux', 'Darwain' etc.\n\n#\n\n#   XHOSTTYPE <name1> <name2> ...\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the names of the host system type to *not* include\n\n#     the test.  This check is performed after the check for the host system\n\n#     names in the 'HOSTTYPE' list if it should exist.  Therefore, this list\n\n#     exclusion list overrides the 'HOSTTYPE' inclusion list.\n\n#\n\n#   STANDARD_PASS_OUTPUT\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then the standard test output \"End Result: TEST PASSED\" is\n\n#     greped for to determine success.  This is needed for MPI tests on some\n\n#     platforms since the return value is unreliable.\n\n#\n\n#   PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION \"<regex1>;<regex2>;...\" \n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then a test will be assumed to pass only if one of the\n\n#     regular expressions <regex1>, <regex2> etc. match the output.\n\n#     Otherwise, the test will fail.\n\n#\n\n#   FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION \"<regex1>;<regex2>;...\"\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then a test will be assumed to fail if one of the regular\n\n#     expressions <regex1>, <regex2> etc. match the output.  Otherwise, the\n\n#     test will pass.\n\n#\n\n#   WILL_FAIL\n\n#\n\n#     If passed in, then the pass/fail criteria will be inverted.\n\n#\n\n# NOTES:\n\n#\n\n# 1) The test can be disabled by setting the variable\n\n# ${PACKAGE_NAME}_${TEST_NAME}_DISABLE=TRUE (perhaps in the cache).  This allows\n\n# tests to be disable on a case-by-case basis.  Here, TEST_NAME is ${EXE_NAME}\n\n# plus any other postfixes.  This is the name that shows up in 'ctest -N' when\n\n# running the test.\n\n#\n",

The latex output is placed\n\n#       in LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH or CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR if the former is\n\n#       not set.  The latex program is picky about where files are located,\n\n#       so all input files are copied from the source directory to the\n\n#       output directory.  This includes the target tex file, any tex file\n\n#       listed with the INPUTS option, the bibliography files listed with\n\n#       the BIBFILES option, and any .cls, .bst, and .clo files found in\n\n#       the current source directory.  Images found in the IMAGE_DIRS\n\n#       directories or listed by IMAGES are also copied to the output\n\n#       directory and coverted to an appropriate format if necessary.  Any\n\n#       tex files also listed with the CONFIGURE option are also processed\n\n#       with the CMake CONFIGURE_FILE command (with the @ONLY flag).  Any\n\n#       file listed in CONFIGURE but not the target tex file or listed with\n\n#       INPUTS has no effect. DEPENDS can be used to specify generated files\n\n#       that are needed to compile the latex target.\n\n#\n\n#       The following targets are made:\n\n#               dvi: Makes <name>.dvi\n\n#               pdf: Makes <name>.pdf using pdflatex.\n\n#               safepdf: Makes <name>.pdf using ps2pdf.  If using the default\n\n#                       program arguments, this will ensure all fonts are\n\n#                       embedded and no lossy compression has been performed\n\n#                       on images.\n\n#               ps: Makes <name>.ps\n\n#               html: Makes <name>.html\n\n#               auxclean: Deletes <name>.aux and other auxiliary files.\n\n#                       This is sometimes necessary if a LaTeX error occurs\n\n#                       and writes a bad aux file.  Unlike the regular clean\n\n#                       target, it does not delete other input files, such as\n\n#                       converted images, to save time on the rebuild.\n\n#\n\n#       The dvi target is added to the ALL.  That is, it will be the target\n\n#       built by default.  If the DEFAULT_PDF argument is given, then the\n\n#       pdf target will be the default instead of dvi.\n\n#\n\n#       If the argument MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES is given, then each of the\n\n#       target names above will be mangled with the <tex_file> name.  This\n\n#       is to make the targets unique if ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT is called for\n\n#       multiple documents.  If the argument USE_INDEX is given, then\n\n#       commands to build an index are made.  If the argument USE_GLOSSARY\n\n#       is given, then commands to build a glossary are made.  If the\n\n#       argument MULTIBIB_NEWCITES is given, then additional bibtex calls\n\n#       are added to the build to support the extra auxiliary files created\n\n#       with the \\newcite command in the multibib package.\n\n#\n\n# History:\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.0 Add support for the multibib package (thanks to Antonio LaTorre).\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.2 Fix corner case when an argument name was also a variable containing\n\n#       the text of an argument.  In this case, the CMake IF was matching\n\n#       the argument text with the contents of the variable with the same\n\n#       argument name.\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.1 Fix problem where ps2pdf was not getting the appropriate arguments.\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.0 Add support for synctex.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.7 Support calling xindy when making glossaries.\n\n#\n\n#       Improved make clean support.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.6 Add support for the nomencl package (thanks to Myles English).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.5 Fix issue with bibfiles being copied two different ways, which causes\n\n#       Problems with dependencies (thanks to Edwin van Leeuwen).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.4 Added the DEFAULT_SAFEPDF option (thanks to Raymond Wan).\n\n#\n\n#       Added warnings when image directories are not found (and were\n\n#       probably not given relative to the source directory).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.3 Fix some issues with interactions between makeglossaries and bibtex\n\n#       (thanks to Mark de Wever).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.2 Use ps2pdf to convert eps to pdf to get around the problem with\n\n#       ImageMagick dropping the bounding box (thanks to Lukasz Lis).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.1 Fixed some dependency issues.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.0 Added DEPENDS options (thanks to Theodore Papadopoulo).\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.1 Ported the makeglossaries command to CMake and embedded the port\n\n#       into UseLATEX.cmake.\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.0 Allow the use of the makeglossaries command.  Thanks to Oystein\n\n#       S. Haaland for the patch.\n\n#\n\n# 1.5.0 Allow any type of file in the INPUTS lists, not just tex file\n\n#       (suggested by Eric Noulard).  As a consequence, the ability to\n\n#       specify tex files without the .tex extension is removed.  The removed\n\n#       function is of dubious value anyway.\n\n#\n\n#       When copying input files, skip over any file that exists in the\n\n#       binary directory but does not exist in the source directory with the\n\n#       assumption that these files were added by some other mechanism.  I\n\n#       find this useful when creating large documents with multiple\n\n#       chapters that I want to build separately (for speed) as I work on\n\n#       them.  I use the same boilerplate as the starting point for all\n\n#       and just copy it with different configurations.  This was what the\n\n#       separate ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT method was supposed to originally be for.\n\n#       Since its external use is pretty much deprecated, I removed that\n\n#       documentation.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.1 Copy .sty files along with the other class and package files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.0 Added a MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES option that will mangle the target names.\n\n#\n\n#       Fixed problem with copying bib files that became apparent with\n\n#       CMake 2.4.\n\n#\n\n# 1.3.0 Added a LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH variable that allows you or the user to\n\n#       specify where the built latex documents to go.  This is especially\n\n#       handy if you want to do in-source builds.\n\n#\n\n#       Removed the ADD_LATEX_IMAGES macro and absorbed the functionality\n\n#       into ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT.  The old interface was always kind of\n\n#       clunky anyway since you had to specify the image directory in both\n\n#       places.  It also made supporting LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH problematic.\n\n#\n\n#       Added support for jpeg files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.2.0 Changed the configuration options yet again.  Removed the NO_CONFIGURE\n\n#       Replaced it with a CONFIGURE option that lists input files for which\n\n#       configure should be run.\n\n#\n\n#       The pdf target no longer depends on the dvi target.  This allows you\n\n#       to build latex documents that require pdflatex.  Also added an option\n\n#       to make the pdf target the default one.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.1 Added the NO_CONFIGURE option.  The @ character can be used when\n\n#       specifying table column separators.  If two or more are used, then\n\n#       will incorrectly substitute them.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.0 Added ability include multiple bib files.  Added ability to do copy\n\n#       sub-tex files for multipart tex files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.0.0 If both ps and pdf type images exist, just copy the one that\n\n#       matches the current render mode.  Replaced a bunch of STRING\n\n#       commands with GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT commands that were made to do\n\n#       the desired function.\n\n#\n\n# 0.4.0 First version posted to CMake Wiki.\n\n#\n",
