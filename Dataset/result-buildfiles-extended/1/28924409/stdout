The full\n\n#     executable name and path is determined in exactly the same way it is in\n\n#     the `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_ function (see `Determining the Executable or\n\n#     Command to Run (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_).  If this is an MPI build, then\n\n#     the executable will be run with MPI using ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>``\n\n#     (or ``OVERALL_NUM_MPI_PROCS <overallNumProcs>`` if ``NUM_MPI_PROCS`` is\n\n#     not set for this test case).  If the maximum number of MPI processes\n\n#     allowed is less than this number of MPI processes, then the test will\n\n#     *not* be run.  Note that ``EXEC <exeRootName>`` when ``NOEXEPREFIX`` and\n\n#     ``NOEXESUFFIX`` are specified is basically equivalent to ``CMND\n\n#     <cmndExec>`` except that in an MPI build, ``<exeRootName>`` is always\n\n#     run using MPI.  In this case, one can pass in ``<exeRootName>`` to any\n\n#     command one would like and it will get run with MPI in MPI mode just\n\n#     link any other MPI-enabled built executable.\n\n#\n\n#   ``CMND <cmndExec>``\n\n#\n\n#     If ``CMND`` is specified, then ``<cmndExec>`` gives the executable for a\n\n#     command to be run.  In this case, MPI will never be used to run the\n\n#     executable even when configured in MPI mode\n\n#     (i.e. ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON``).  If one wants to run an arbitrary command\n\n#     using MPI, use ``EXEC <fullPathToCmndExec> NOEXEPREFIX NOEXESUFFIX``\n\n#     instead.  **WARNING:** If you want to run such tests using valgrind, you\n\n#     have to use the raw executable as the ``<cmndExec>`` argument and *not*\n\n#     the script.  For example, if you have a python script\n\n#     ``my_python_test.py`` with ``/usr/bin/env pyhton`` at the top, you can't\n\n#     just use::\n\n#\n\n#       CMND <path>/my_python_test.py ARGS <arg0> <arg1> ...\n\n#\n\n#     The same goes for Perl or any other scripting language.\n\n#\n\n#     Instead, you have to use::\n\n#\n\n#       CMND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} ARGS <path>/my_python_test.py <arg0> <arg1> ...\n\n#\n\n# By default, the output (stdout/stderr) for each test command is captured and\n\n# is then echoed to stdout for the overall test.  This is done in order to be\n\n# able to grep the result to determine pass/fail.\n\n#\n\n# Other miscellaneous arguments for each ``TEST_<idx>`` block include:\n\n#\n\n#   ``DIRECTORY <dir>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then the executable is assumed to be in the directory\n\n#     given by relative ``<dir>``.  See `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_.\n\n#\n\n#   ``MESSAGE \"<message>\"``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then the string in ``\"<message>\"`` will be printed before\n\n#     this test command is run.  This allows adding some documentation about\n\n#     each individual test invocation to make the test output more\n\n#     understandable.\n\n#\n\n#   ``WORKING_DIRECTORY <workingDir>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then the working directory ``<workingDir>`` (relative or\n\n#     absolute) will be created and the test will be run from within this\n\n#     directory.  If the directory ``<workingDir>`` exists before the test\n\n#     runs, it will be deleted and created again.  If one wants to preserve\n\n#     the contents of this directory between test blocks, then one needs to\n\n#     set ``SKIP_CLEAN_WORKING_DIRECTORY``.  Using a different\n\n#     ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` for individual test commands allows creating\n\n#     independent working directories for each test case.  This would be\n\n#     useful if a single ``OVERALL_WORKING_DIRECTORY`` was not sufficient for\n\n#     some reason.\n\n#\n\n#   ``SKIP_CLEAN_WORKING_DIRECTORY``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then ``<workingDir>`` will **not** be deleted if it\n\n#     already exists.\n\n#\n\n#   ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then ``<numProcs>`` is the number of processors used for\n\n#     MPI executables.

If this is missing, but ``NUM_MPI_PROCS\n\n#     <numProcs>`` is specified, then ``<numProcs>`` is used instead.  If\n\n#     ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED`` is missing BUT ``OVERALL_NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED\n\n#     <overallNumTotalCoresUsed>`` is, then ``<overallNumTotalCoresUsed>`` is\n\n#     used for ``<numTotalCoresUsed>``.  This argument is used for test\n\n#     scripts/executables that use more cores than MPI processes\n\n#     (i.e. ``<numProcs>``) and its only purpose is to inform CTest and\n\n#     TriBITS of the maximum number of cores that are used by the underlying\n\n#     test executable/script.  When ``<numTotalCoresUsed>`` is greater than\n\n#     ``${MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}``, then the test will not be added.\n\n#     Otherwise, the CTest property ``PROCESSORS`` is set to the max over all\n\n#     ``<numTotalCoresUsed>`` so that CTest knows how to best schedule the\n\n#     test w.r.t. other tests on a given number of available processes.\n\n#\n\n#   ``OUTPUT_FILE <outputFile>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then stdout and stderr for the test case will be sent to\n\n#     ``<outputFile>``.

Therefore, you can't write any tests that\n\n#     depend on the order of STDOUT and STDERR output in relation to each\n\n#     other.  Also note that all of STDOUT and STDERR will be first read into\n\n#     the CTest executable process main memory before the file\n\n#     ``<outputFile>`` is written.  Therefore, don't run executables or\n\n#     commands that generate massive amounts of console output or it may\n\n#     exhaust main memory.  Instead, have the command or executable write\n\n#     directly to a file instead of going through STDOUT.\n\n#\n\n#   ``NO_ECHO_OUTPUT``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then the output for the test command will not be echoed to\n\n#     the output for the entire test command.\n\n#\n\n# By default, an individual test case ``TEST_<IDX>`` is assumed to pass if the\n\n# executable or commands returns a non-zero value to the shell.

TEST_1 ...``) and the test cases must be consecutive integers\n\n#   (e.g. can't jump from ``TEST_5`` to ``TEST_7``).\n\n#\n\n# * All of the arguments for a test case must appear directly below its\n\n#   ``TEST_<idx>`` keyword and before the next ``TEST_<idx+1>`` keyword or\n\n#   before any trailing overall keyword arguments.\n\n#\n\n# * None of the overall arguments (e.g. ``CATEGORIES``) can be listed inside\n\n#   of a ``TEST_<idx>`` block but otherwise can be listed before or after all\n\n#   of the ``TEST_<idx>`` blocks.  (NOTE: The current implementation will\n\n#   actually allow overall arguments to be listed after all of the local\n\n#   arguments before the next TEST_<idx> block but this is confusing and will\n\n#   not be allowed in a future implementation).\n\n#\n\n# Other than that, the keyword arguments and options can appear in any order.\n\n#\n\n# ..

Therefore, any tests\n\n# properties that are not directly supported by this function and passed\n\n# through the argument list to this wrapper function can be set in the outer\n\n# ``CMakeLists.txt`` file after the call to ``TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()``.\n\n# For example::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST_TEST( someTest ...\n\n#     ADDED_TEST_NAME_OUT  someTest_TEST_NAME )\n\n#\n\n#   IF (someTest_TEST_NAME)\n\n#     SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES( ${someTest_TEST_NAME}\n\n#       PROPERTIES ATTACHED_FILES someTest.log )\n\n#   ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n# where the test writes a log file ``someTest.log`` that we want to submit to\n\n# CDash also.\n\n#\n\n# This approach will work no matter what TriBITS names the individual test(s)\n\n# or whether the test(s) are added or not (depending on other arguments like\n\n# ``COMM``, ``XHOST``, etc.).\n\n#\n\n# The following built-in CTest test properties are set through `Overall\n\n# Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST())`_ or are otherwise automatically set\n\n# by this function and should **NOT** be overridden by direct calls to\n\n# ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()``: ``ENVIRONMENT``, ``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION``,\n\n# ``LABELS``, ``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION``, ``RUN_SERIAL``, ``TIMEOUT``,\n\n# ``WILL_FAIL``, and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``.\n\n#\n\n# However, generally, other built-in CTest test properties can be set after\n\n# the test is added like show above.  Examples of test properties that can be\n\n# set using direct calls to ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()`` include\n\n# ``ATTACHED_FILES``, ``ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL``, ``COST``, ``DEPENDS``,\n\n# ``MEASUREMENT``, and ``RESOURCE_LOCK``.\n\n#\n\n# For example, one can set a dependency between two tests using::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST_TEST( test_a [...]\n\n#      ADDED_TEST_NAME_OUT  test_a_TEST_NAME )\n\n#   \n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST_TEST( test_b [...]\n\n#      ADDED_TEST_NAME_OUT  test_z_TEST_NAME )\n\n#   \n\n#   IF (test_a_TEST_NAME AND test_b_TEST_NAME)\n\n#     SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES(${test_b_TEST_NAME}\n\n#       PROPERTIES DEPENDS ${test_a_TEST_NAME})\n\n#   ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n# This ensures that test ``test_b`` will always be run after ``test_a`` if\n\n# both tests are run by CTest.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Running multiple tests at the same time (TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Running multiple tests at the same time (TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# Just as with `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_, setting ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>`` or\n\n# ``OVERALL_NUM_MPI_PROCS <numOverallProcs>`` or ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED\n\n# <numTotalCoresUsed>`` or ``OVERALL_NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED\n\n# <overallNumTotalCoresUsed>`` will set the ``PROCESSORS`` CTest property to\n\n# allow CTest to schedule and run multiple tests at the same time when ``'ctest\n\n# -j<N>'`` is used (see `Running multiple tests at the same time\n\n# (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Disabling Tests Externally (TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Disabling Tests Externally (TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# The test can be disabled externally by setting the CMake cache variable\n\n# ``<testName>_DISABLE=TRUE``.

Note\n\n#     that regular libraries (i.e. not ``TESTONLY``) defined in the current SE\n\n#     package or any upstream SE packages can *NOT* be listed!  TriBITS\n\n#     automatically links non ``TESTONLY`` libraries in this package and\n\n#     upstream packages to the executable.  The only libraries that should be\n\n#     listed in this argument are either ``TESTONLY`` libraries.  The include\n\n#     directories for each test-only library will automatically be added\n\n#     using::\n\n#\n\n#       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS})\n\n#\n\n#     where ``<libi>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` was set by::\n\n#\n\n#       TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY(<libi> ...

This can only be used for libraries\n\n#     that are built external from this CMake project and are not provided\n\n#     through a proper `TriBITS TPL`_.  The latter usage of passing in\n\n#     external libraries is not recommended.  External libraries should be\n\n#     handled as declared `TriBITS TPLs`_.  So far, the only case where\n\n#     ``IMPORTEDLIBS`` has been shown to be necessary is to pass in the\n\n#     standard C math library ``m``.  In every other case, a TriBITS TPL\n\n#     should be used instead.\n\n#\n\n#   ``COMM [serial] [mpi]``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, selects if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI\n\n#     mode.  See the ``COMM`` argument in the script\n\n#     `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_ for more details.\n\n#\n\n#   ``LINKER_LANGUAGE (C|CXX|Fortran)``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, overrides the linker language used by setting the built-in\n\n#     CMake target property ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``.  TriBITS sets the default\n\n#     linker language as follows::\n\n#\n\n#       IF (${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_CXX)\n\n#         SET(LINKER_LANGUAGE CXX)\n\n#       ELSEIF (${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_C)\n\n#         SET(LINKER_LANGUAGE C)\n\n#       ELSE()\n\n#         # Let CMake set the default linker language it wants based\n\n#         # on source file extensions passed into ``ADD_EXECUTABLE()``.\n\n#       ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n#     The reason for this logic is that on some platform if you have a Fortran\n\n#     or C main that links to C++ libraries, then you need the C++ compiler to\n\n#     do the final linking.  CMake does not seem to automatically know that it\n\n#     is pulling in C++ libraries and therefore needs to be told use C++ for\n\n#     linking.  This is the correct default behavior for mixed-language\n\n#     projects. However, this argument allows the developer to override this\n\n#     logic and use any linker language desired based on other considerations.\n\n#\n\n#   ``TARGET_DEFINES -D<define0> -D<define1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     Add the listed defines using\n\n#     ``TARGET_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS(<exeTargetName> ...)``.  These should only\n\n#     affect the listed sources for the built executable and not other\n\n#     targets.\n\n#\n\n#   ``INSTALLABLE``\n\n#\n\n#     If passed in, then an install target will be added to install the built\n\n#     executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory (see\n\n#     `Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).\n\n#\n\n#   ``ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT <exeTargetName>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then on output the variable ``<exeTargetName>`` will be\n\n#     set with the name of the executable target passed to\n\n#     ``ADD_EXECUTABLE(<exeTargetName> ... )``.  Having this name allows the\n\n#     calling ``CMakeLists.txt`` file access and set additional target\n\n#     properties (see `Additional Executable and Source File Properties\n\n#     (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):\n\n#\n\n# **Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**\n\n#\n\n# By default, the full name of the executable and target name\n\n# is::\n\n#\n\n#   <exeTargetName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>\n\n#\n\n# If ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME`` is set, then the directory path relative to the\n\n# package base directory (with \"/\" replaced with \"_\"), or ``<relDirName>``, is\n\n# added to the executable name to form::\n\n#\n\n#   <exeTargetName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<relDirName>_<exeRootName>\n\n#\n\n# If the option ``NOEXEPREFIX`` is passed in, then the prefix\n\n# ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_`` is removed.\n\n#\n\n# The executable suffix ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}`` will be\n\n# added to the actual executable file name if the option ``NOEXESUFFIX`` is\n\n# *not* passed in but this suffix is never added to the target name.\n\n# (However, note that on Windows platforms, the default ``*.exe`` extension is\n\n# always added because windows will not run an executable in many contexts\n\n# unless it has the ``*.exe`` extension.)\n\n#\n\n# The reason that a default prefix is prepended to the executable and target\n\n# name is because the primary reason to create an executable is typically to\n\n# create a test or an example that is private to the package.  This prefix\n\n# helps to namespace the executable and its target so as to avoid name clashes\n\n# with targets in other packages.  It also helps to avoid clashes if the\n\n# executable gets installed into the install directory (if ``INSTALLABLE`` is\n\n# specified).  For general utility executables on Linux/Unix systems,\n\n# ``NOEXEPREFIX`` and ``NOEXESUFFIX`` should be passed in.  In this case, one\n\n# must be careful to pick ``<exeRootName>`` that will be sufficiently globally\n\n# unique.  Please use common sense when picking non-namespaced names.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Additional Executable and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):\n\n#\n\n# **Additional Executable and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**\n\n#\n\n# Once ``ADD_EXECUTABLE(<exeTargetName> ... )`` is called and this function\n\n# exists, one can set and change properties on the ``<exeTargetName>``\n\n# executable target using the built-in ``SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES()`` command as\n\n# well as properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using\n\n# the built-in ``SET_SOURCE_FILE_PROPERTIES()`` command just like in any CMake\n\n# project.  IF the executable is added, its name will be returned by the\n\n# argument ``ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT <exeTargetName>``.  For example::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE( someExe ...\n\n#     ADDED_EXE_TARGET_NAME_OUT  someExe_TARGET_NAME )\n\n#\n\n#   IF (someExe_TARGET_NAME)\n\n#     SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES( ${someExe_TARGET_NAME}\n\n#       PROPERTIES  LINKER_LANGUAGE  CXX )\n\n#   ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n# The ``IF(someExe_TARGET_NAME)`` is needed in case the executable does not\n\n# get added for some reason (see `Formal Arguments\n\n# (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_ for logic that can result in the executable\n\n# target not getting added).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()):\n\n#\n\n# **Install Target (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())**\n\n#\n\n# If ``INSTALLABLE`` is passed in, then an install target using the built-in\n\n# CMake command ``INSTALL(TARGETS <exeTargetName> ...)`` is added to install\n\n# the built executable into the ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/`` directory\n\n# (actual install directory path is determined by\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_RUNTIME_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix at\n\n# configure time`_) .\n\n#\n",

The main purpose of this argument\n\n#     is to allow multiple tests to be defined for the same executable.  CTest\n\n#     requires all test names to be globally unique in a single project.

This is useful for devices (like CUDA GPUs) that require\n\n#     exclusive access for processes/threads.  This just sets the CTest test\n\n#     property ``RUN_SERIAL`` using the built-in CMake function\n\n#     ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()``.\n\n#\n\n#   ``ARGS \"<arg0> <arg1> ...\" \"<arg2> <arg3> ...\" ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then a set of arguments can be passed in quotes.  If\n\n#     multiple groups of arguments are passed in different quoted clusters of\n\n#     arguments then a different test will be added for each set of arguments.\n\n#     In this way, many different tests can be added for a single executable\n\n#     in a single call to this function.  Each of these separate tests will be\n\n#     named ``<fullTestName>_xy`` where ``xy`` = ``00``, ``01``, ``02``, and so\n\n#     on.  **WARNING:** When defining multiple tests it is preferred to use the\n\n#     ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX>`` form instead.  **WARNING:** Multiple\n\n#     arguments passed to a single test invocation must be quoted or multiple\n\n#     tests taking single arguments will be created instead!  See `Adding\n\n#     Multiple Tests (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_ for more details and examples.\n\n#\n\n#   ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX> <postfix> <arg0> <arg1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a sequence of sets of test postfix names and\n\n#     arguments lists for different tests (up to ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_19``).\n\n#     For example, a set of three different tests with argument lists can be\n\n#     specified as::\n\n#\n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_0 postfix0 --arg1 --arg2=\"dummy\"\n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_1 postfix1  --arg2=\"fly\"\n\n#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_2 postfix2  --arg2=\"bags\"\n\n#\n\n#     This will create three different test cases with the postfix names\n\n#     ``postfix0``, ``postfix1``, and ``postfix2``.  The indexes must be\n\n#     consecutive starting a ``0`` and going up to (currently) ``19``.  The\n\n#     main advantages of using these arguments instead of just ``ARGS`` are\n\n#     that one can give a meaningful name to each test case and one can\n\n#     specify multiple arguments without having to quote them and one can\n\n#     allow long argument lists to span multiple lines.  See `Adding Multiple\n\n#     Tests (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_ for more details and examples.\n\n#\n\n#   ``COMM [serial] [mpi]``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, determines if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI\n\n#     mode.  If the ``COMM`` argument is missing, the test will be added in\n\n#     both serial and MPI builds of the code.  That is if ``COMM mpi`` is\n\n#     passed in, then the test will **not** be added if\n\n#     ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=OFF``.  Likewise, if ``COMM serial`` is passed in, then\n\n#     the test will **not** be added if ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON``.  If ``COMM\n\n#     serial mpi`` or ``COMM mpi serial`` is passed in, then the value of\n\n#     ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI`` does not determine if the test is added or not.\n\n#\n\n#   ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numMpiProcs>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the number of MPI processes used to run the test\n\n#     with the MPI exec program ``${MPI_EXEC}``.  If ``<numMpiProcs>`` is greater\n\n#     than ``${MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}`` then the test will be excluded.  If\n\n#     not specified, then the default number of processes for an MPI build\n\n#     (i.e. ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON``) will be ``${MPI_EXEC_DEFAULT_NUMPROCS}``.\n\n#     For serial builds (i.e. ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=OFF``), this argument is\n\n#     ignored.  This will also be set as the built-in test property\n\n#     ``PROCESSORS`` if ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED`` is not specified.\n\n#\n\n#   ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED <numTotalCoresUsed>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the total number of processes or cores that is\n\n#     reported to CTest as the built-in CTest ``PROCESSORS`` property.  If\n\n#     this is not specified, then ``PROCESSORS`` is specified by the argument\n\n#     ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numMpiProcs>``.  This argument is used for test\n\n#     scripts/executables that use more cores than MPI processes\n\n#     (i.e. ``<numMpiProcs>``) and its only purpose is to inform CTest and\n\n#     TriBITS of the maximum number of processes or cores that are used by the\n\n#     underlying test executable/script.  When specified, if\n\n#     ``<numTotalCoresUsed>`` is greater than ``${MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}``,\n\n#     then the test will not be added.  Otherwise, the CTest property\n\n#     ``PROCESSORS`` is set to ``<numTotalCoresUsed>`` so that CTest knows how\n\n#     to best schedule the test w.r.t. other tests on a given number of\n\n#     available processes.  See `Running multiple tests at the same time\n\n#     (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_.\n\n#\n\n#   ``CATEGORIES <category0> <category1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the specific categories of the test.  Valid test\n\n#     categories include ``BASIC``, ``CONTINUOUS``, ``NIGHTLY``, ``HEAVY``\n\n#     and ``PERFORMANCE``.  If not specified, the default category is\n\n#     ``BASIC``.  When the test category does not match\n\n#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES``, then the test is **not** added.\n\n#     When ``CATEGORIES`` contains ``BASIC`` it will match\n\n#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES`` equal to ``CONTINUOUS``,\n\n#     ``NIGHTLY``, and ``HEAVY``.  When ``CATEGORIES`` contains\n\n#     ``CONTINUOUS`` it will match ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES`` equal\n\n#     to ``CONTINUOUS``, ``NIGHTLY``, and ``HEAVY``.  When ``CATEGORIES``\n\n#     contains ``NIGHTLY`` it will match ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES``\n\n#     equal to ``NIGHTLY`` and ``HEAVY``.  When ``CATEGORIES`` contains\n\n#     ``PERFORMANCE`` it will match\n\n#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES=PERFORMANCE`` only.\n\n#\n\n#   ``HOST <host0> <host1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames where the test will be included.\n\n#     The current hostname is determined by the built-in CMake command\n\n#     ``SITE_NAME(${PROJECT_NAME}_HOSTNAME)``.  On Linux/Unix systems, this is\n\n#     typically the value returned by ``uname -n``.  If this list is given,\n\n#     the value of ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_HOSTNAME}`` must equal one of the\n\n#     listed host names ``<hosti>`` or test will **not** be added.  The value\n\n#     of ``${PROJECT_NAME}_HOSTNAME`` gets printed out in the TriBITS cmake\n\n#     output under the section ``Probing the environment`` (see `Full\n\n#     Processing of TriBITS Project Files`_).\n\n#\n\n#   ``XHOST <host0> <host1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames (see ``HOST`` argument) on which\n\n#     the test will **not** be added.  This check is performed after the check\n\n#     for the hostnames in the ``HOST`` list if it should exist.  Therefore,\n\n#     this exclusion list overrides the ``HOST`` inclusion list.\n\n#\n\n#   ``HOSTTYPE <hosttype0> <hosttype1> ...``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, gives the names of the host system type (given by the\n\n#     built-in CMake cache variable ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`` which is\n\n#     printed in the TriBITS cmake configure output in the section ``Probing\n\n#     the environment``) for which the test is allowed to be added.  If\n\n#     ``HOSTTYPE`` is specified and ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`` is not equal to\n\n#     one of the values of ``<hosttypei>``, then the test will **not** be\n\n#     added.

Therefore, this\n\n# wrapper function does not provide any fundamentally new features that are\n\n# not already available in the basic usage if CMake/CTest.  However, this\n\n# wrapper function takes care of many of the details and boiler-plate CMake\n\n# code that it takes to add such a test (or tests) and enforces consistency\n\n# across a large project for how tests are defined, run, and named (to avoid\n\n# test name clashes).\n\n#\n\n# If more flexibility or control is needed when defining tests, then the\n\n# function `TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()`_ should be used instead.\n\n#\n\n# In the following subsections, more details on how tests are defined and run\n\n# is given.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Determining the Executable or Command to Run (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Determining the Executable or Command to Run (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# This function is primarily designed to make it easy to run tests for\n\n# executables built using the function `TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()`_.  To set up\n\n# tests to run arbitrary executables, see below.\n\n#\n\n# By default, the executable to run is determined by first getting the\n\n# executable name which by default is assumed to be::\n\n#\n\n#  <fullExeName> =\n\n#    ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>${${PROJECT_NAME}_CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX}\n\n#\n\n# which is (by no coincidence) identical to how it is selected in\n\n# `TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()`_ (see `Executable and Target Name\n\n# (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_).  This name can be altered by passing in\n\n# ``NOEXEPREFIX``, ``NOEXESUFFIX``, and ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME`` as described in\n\n# `Executable and Target Name (TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE())`_.\n\n#\n\n# By default, this executable is assumed to be in the current CMake binary\n\n# directory ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` but the directory location can be\n\n# changed using the ``DIRECTORY <dir>`` argument.\n\n#\n\n# If an arbitrary executable is to be run (i.e. not build inside of the\n\n# project), then pass in ``NOEXEPREFIX`` and ``NOEXESUFFIX`` and set\n\n# ``<exeRootName>`` to the relative or absolute path of the executable to be\n\n# run.  If ``<exeRootName>`` is not an absolute path, then\n\n# ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<exeRootName>`` is set as the executable to\n\n# run in this case.\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: On native Windows platforms, the ``NOEXESUFFIX`` will still allow\n\n# CTest to run executables that have the ``*.exe`` suffix.\n\n#\n\n# Whatever executable path is specified using this logic, if the executable is\n\n# not found, then when ``ctest`` goes to run the test, it will mark it as\n\n# ``NOT RUN``.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Determining the Full Test Name (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Determining the Full Test Name (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# By default, the base test name is selected to be::\n\n#\n\n#   <fullTestName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>\n\n#\n\n# If ``NAME <testRootName>`` is passed in, then ``<testRootName>`` is used\n\n# instead of ``<exeRootName>`` above.\n\n#\n\n# If ``NAME_POSTFIX <testNamePostfix>`` is passed in, then the base test name\n\n# is selected to be::\n\n#\n\n#   <fullTestName> = ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<exeRootName>_<testNamePostfix>\n\n#\n\n# If ``ADD_DIR_TO_NAME`` is passed in, then the directory name relative to the\n\n# package base directory is added to the name as well to help disambiguate the\n\n# test name (see the above).\n\n#\n\n# Let the test name determined as described above be ``<fullTestName>``.  If\n\n# no arguments or only a single set of arguments are passed in through\n\n# ``ARGS``, then this is the test name actually passed in to ``ADD_TEST()``.\n\n# If multiple tests are defined, then this name becomes the base test name for\n\n# each of the tests (see `Adding Multiple Tests (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_).\n\n#\n\n# Finally, for any test that gets defined, if MPI is enabled\n\n# (i.e. ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON``), then the terminal suffix\n\n# ``_MPI_${NUM_MPI_PROCS}`` will be added to the end of the test name (even\n\n# for multiple tests).  No such prefix is added for the serial case\n\n# (i.e. ``TPL_ENABLE_MPI=OFF``).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Adding Multiple Tests  (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Adding Multiple Tests  (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# Using this function, one can add executable arguments and can even add\n\n# multiple tests in one of two ways.  One can either pass in one or more\n\n# **quoted** clusters of arguments using::\n\n#\n\n#   ARGS \"<arg0> <arg1> ...\" \"<arg2> <arg3> ...\" ...\n\n#\n\n# or can pass in an explicit test name postfix and arguments with::\n\n#\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_0 <postfix0> <arg0> <arg1> ...\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_1 <postfix1> <arg2> ...\n\n#   ...\n\n#\n\n# If only one short set of arguments needs to be passed in, then passing::\n\n#\n\n#   ARGS \"<arg0> <arg1>\"\n\n#\n\n# may be preferable since it will not add any postfix name to the test.  To\n\n# add more than one test case using ``ARGS``, one will use more than one\n\n# quoted set of arguments such as with::\n\n#\n\n#   ARGS \"<arg0> <arg1>\" \"<arg2> <arg2>\"\n\n#\n\n# which creates 2 tests with the names ``<fullTestName>_00`` passing\n\n# arguments ``\"<arg0> <arg1>\"`` and ``<fullTestName>_01`` passing arguments\n\n# ``\"<arg2> <arg3>\"``.  However, when passing multiple sets of arguments it is\n\n# preferable to **not** use ``ARGS`` but instead use::\n\n#\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_0 test_a <arg0> <arg1>\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_1 test_b <arg2> <arg2>\n\n#\n\n# which also creates the same 2 tests but now with the improved names\n\n# ``<fullTestName>_test_a`` passing arguments ``\"<arg0> <arg1>\"`` and\n\n# ``<fullTestName>_test_b`` passing arguments ``\"<arg2> <arg3>\"``.  In this way,\n\n# the individual tests can be given more understandable names.\n\n#\n\n# The other advantage of the ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX>`` form is that the\n\n# arguments ``<arg0>``, ``<arg1>``, ... do not need to be quoted and can\n\n# therefore be extended over multiple lines like::\n\n#\n\n#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_0 long_args --this-is-the-first-long-arg=very\n\n#     --this-is-the-second-long-arg=verylong\n\n#\n\n# If one does not use quotes when using ``ARGS`` one will actually get more\n\n# than one test.  For example, if one passes in::\n\n#\n\n#   ARGS --this-is-the-first-long-arg=very\n\n#     --this-is-the-second-long-arg=verylong\n\n#\n\n# one actually gets two tests, not one test.  This is a common mistake that\n\n# people make when using the ``ARGS`` form of passing arguments.  This can't\n\n# be fixed or it will break backward compatibility.  If this could be designed\n\n# fresh, the ``ARGS`` argument would only create a single test and the\n\n# arguments would not be quoted.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Determining Pass/Fail (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Determining Pass/Fail (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# The only means to determine pass/fail is to use the built-in CTest\n\n# properties ``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` and ``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` which\n\n# can only grep the test's STDOUT/STDERR or to check for a 0 return value (or\n\n# invert these using ``WILL_FAIL``).  For simple tests, that is enough.\n\n# However, for more complex executables, one may need to examine one or more\n\n# output files to determine pass/fail.  Raw CMake/CTest cannot do this.  In\n\n# this case, one should use `TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()`_ instead to add the\n\n# test.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Setting additional test properties (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Setting additional test properties (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# After this function returns, any tests that get added using ``ADD_TEST()``\n\n# can have additional properties set and changed using\n\n# ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()``.  Therefore, any tests properties that are not\n\n# directly supported and passed through this wrapper function can be set in\n\n# the outer ``CMakeLists.txt`` file after the call to ``TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()``.\n\n#\n\n# If tests are added, then the names of those tests will be returned in the\n\n# variable ``ADDED_TESTS_NAMES_OUT <testsNames>``.  This can be used, for\n\n# example, to override the ``PROCESSORS`` property for the tests with::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_TEST( someTest ...\n\n#     ADDED_TESTS_NAMES_OUT  someTest_TEST_NAME )\n\n#\n\n#   IF (someTest_TEST_NAME)\n\n#     SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES( ${someTest_TEST_NAME}\n\n#       PROPERTIES ATTACHED_FILES someTest.log )\n\n#   ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n# where the test writes a log file ``someTest.log`` that we want to submit to\n\n# CDash also.\n\n#\n\n# This approach will work no matter what TriBITS names the individual test(s)\n\n# or whether the test(s) are added or not (depending on other arguments like\n\n# ``COMM``, ``XHOST``, etc.).\n\n#\n\n# The following built-in CTest test properties are set through `Formal\n\n# Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_ or are otherwise automatically set by this\n\n# function and should **NOT** be overridden by direct calls to\n\n# ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()``: ``ENVIRONMENT``, ``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION``,\n\n# ``LABELS``, ``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION``, ``RUN_SERIAL``, ``TIMEOUT``, and\n\n# ``WILL_FAIL``.\n\n#\n\n# However, generally, other built-in CTest test properties can be set after\n\n# the test is added like show above.  Examples of test properties that can be\n\n# set using direct calls to ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()`` include\n\n# ``ATTACHED_FILES``, ``ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL``, ``COST``, ``DEPENDS``,\n\n# ``MEASUREMENT``, ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``.\n\n#\n\n# For example, one can set a dependency between two tests using::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_TEST_TEST( test_a [...]\n\n#      ADDED_TEST_NAME_OUT  test_a_TEST_NAME )\n\n#   \n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_TEST_TEST( test_b [...]\n\n#      ADDED_TEST_NAME_OUT  test_z_TEST_NAME )\n\n#   \n\n#   IF (test_a_TEST_NAME AND test_b_TEST_NAME)\n\n#     SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES(${test_b_TEST_NAME}\n\n#       PROPERTIES DEPENDS ${test_a_TEST_NAME})\n\n#   ENDIF()\n\n#\n\n# This ensures that test ``test_b`` will always be run after ``test_a`` if\n\n# both tests are run by CTest.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Running multiple tests at the same time (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Running multiple tests at the same time (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# By default, CTest will run as many tests defined with ``ADD_TEST()`` at same\n\n# time as it can according to its parallel level (e.g. ``'ctest -j<N>'`` or\n\n# the CTest property ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL``).  For example, when raw\n\n# ``'ctest -j10'`` is run, CTest will run multiple tests at the same time to\n\n# try to make usage of 10 processors/cores.  If all of the defined tests only\n\n# used one process (which is assumed by default except for MPI tests), then\n\n# CTest will run 10 tests at the same time and will launch new tests as\n\n# running tests finish.  One can also define tests which use more than one\n\n# process or use more cores than the number of MPI processes.  When passing in\n\n# ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numMpiProcs>`` (see above), this TriBITS function will set the\n\n# built-in CTest property ``PROCESSORS`` to ``<numMpiProcs>`` using::\n\n#\n\n#   SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES(<fullTestName> PROPERTIES PROCESSORS <numMpiProcs>)\n\n#\n\n# This tells CTest that the defined test uses ``<numMpiProcs>`` processes and\n\n# CTest will use that information to not exceed the requested parallel level.\n\n# For example, if several ``NUM_MPI_PROCS 3`` tests are defined and CTest is\n\n# run with ``'ctest -j12'``, then CTest would schedule and run 4 of these\n\n# tests at a time (to make use of 12 processors/cores on the machine),\n\n# starting new tests as running tests finish, until all of the tests have been\n\n# run.\n\n#\n\n# There are some situations where a test will use more processes/cores than\n\n# specified by ``NUM_MPI_PROCS <numMpiProcs>`` such as when the underlying\n\n# executable fires off more processes in parallel to do processing.  Also, an\n\n# MPI program may use threading and therefore use overall more cores than the\n\n# number of MPI processes. For these cases, it is critical to set\n\n# ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED <numTotalCoresUsed>`` to tell TriBITS and CTest how\n\n# many cores will be used by a threaded test.  This is needed to exclude the\n\n# test if there are too many processes/cores needed to run the test than are\n\n# available.  Also, if the test is added, then this is needed to set the\n\n# built-in CTest ``PROCESSORS`` property so CTest can avoid overloading the\n\n# machine.  For example, for test where the MPI executable running on 4\n\n# processes uses 10 threads per process, one would set::\n\n#\n\n#    NUM_MPI_PROCS  4  NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED  40\n\n#\n\n# In this case, it sets the CTest ``PROCESSORS`` property as::\n\n#\n\n#   SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES(<fullTestName> PROPERTIES PROCESSORS <numTotalCoresUsed>)\n\n#\n\n# When the number of processes a test uses does not cleanly divide into the\n\n# requested CTest parallel level, it is not clear how CTest schedules the\n\n# tests (hard to find documentation on this but one could always inspect the\n\n# CTest source code to find out for sure).  However, one boundary case that is\n\n# well observed is that CTest will run all defined tests regardless of the\n\n# size of the ``PROCESSORS`` property or the value of\n\n# ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL``.  For example, if there are tests where\n\n# ``PROCESSORS`` is set to 20 but ```ctest -j10'`` is used, then CTest will\n\n# still run those tests (using 20 processes) but will not schedule any other\n\n# tests while the parallel level is exceeded.  This can overload the machine\n\n# obviously.  Therefore, always set ``MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS`` to the maximum\n\n# number of cores/processes that can be comfortably run on a given machine.\n\n# Also note that MPI tests are very fragile to overloaded machines\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: **Never** manually override the ``PROCESSORS`` CTest property.\n\n# Instead, always using ``NUM_TOTAL_CORES_USED <numTotalCoresUsed>`` to set\n\n# this.  This is important because TriBITS needs to know how many\n\n# processes/cores are required for test so that it can disable the test if the\n\n# test requires more cores/processes than a given machine can handle or to\n\n# exceed an imposed budget of the number processes to be used.  The latter is\n\n# important when running multiple ``ctest -J<N>`` invocations on the same test\n\n# machine.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Setting timeouts for tests (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Setting timeouts for tests (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# By default, all tests have a default timeout (1500 seconds for most\n\n# projects, see `DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`_).  That means that if they hang\n\n# (e.g. as is common when deadlocking occurs with multi-process MPI-based\n\n# tests and multi-threaded tests) then each test may hang for a long time,\n\n# causing the overall test suite to take a long time to complete.  For many\n\n# CMake projects, this default timeout is way too long.\n\n#\n\n# Timeouts for tests can be adjusted in a couple of ways.  First, a default\n\n# timeout for all tests is enforced by CTest given the configured value of the\n\n# variable `DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`_ (typically set by the user but set by\n\n# default to 1500 for most projects).  This is a global timeout that applies\n\n# to all tests that don't otherwise have individual timeouts set using the\n\n# ``TIMEOUT`` CTest property (see below).  The value of\n\n# ``DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`` in the CMake cache on input to CMake will get\n\n# scaled by `${PROJECT_NAME}_SCALE_TEST_TIMEOUT`_ and the scaled value gets\n\n# written into the file ``DartConfiguration.tcl`` as the field ``TimeOut``.\n\n# The``ctest`` executable reads ``TimeOut`` from this file when it runs to\n\n# determine the default global timeout.  The value of this default global\n\n# ``TimeOut`` can be overridden using the ``ctest`` argument ``--timeout\n\n# <seconds>`` (see `Overriding test timeouts`_).\n\n#\n\n# Alternatively, timeouts for individual tests can be set using the input\n\n# argument ``TIMEOUT`` (see `Formal Arguments (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())`_ above).\n\n# The timeout value passed in to this function is then scaled by\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SCALE_TEST_TIMEOUT`` and the scaled timeout is then set as\n\n# the CTest test property ``TIMEOUT``.  One can observe the value of this\n\n# property in the CMake-generated file ``CTestTestfile.cmake`` in the current\n\n# build directory.  Individual test timeouts set this way are not impacted by\n\n# the global default timeout ``DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT`` or the ``ctest``\n\n# argument ``--timeout <seconds>``.\n\n#\n\n# In summary, CTest determines the timeout for any individual test as follows:\n\n#\n\n# * If the ``TIMEOUT`` CTest property in ``CTestTestfile.cmake`` for that test\n\n#   is set, then that value is used.\n\n#\n\n# * Else if the ``ctest`` commandline option ``--timeout <seconds>`` is\n\n#   provided, then that timeout is used.\n\n#\n\n# * Else if the property ``TimeOut`` in the base file\n\n#   ``DartConfiguration.tcl`` is set to non-empty, then that timeout is used.\n\n#\n\n# * Else, no timeout is set and the test can run (and hang) forever until\n\n#   manually killed by the user.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Debugging and Examining Test Generation (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Debugging and Examining Test Generation (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# In order to see what tests get added and if not then why, configure with\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACE_ADD_TEST=ON``.  That will print one line per show\n\n# that the test got added and if not then why the test was not added (i.e. due\n\n# to ``COMM``, ``NUM_MPI_PROCS``, ``CATEGORIES``, ``HOST``, ``XHOST``,\n\n# ``HOSTTYPE``, or ``XHOSTTYPE``).\n\n#\n\n# Also, CMake writes a file ``CTestTestfile.cmake`` in the current binary\n\n# directory which contains all of the added tests and test properties that are\n\n# set.  This is the file that is read by ``ctest`` when it runs to determine\n\n# what tests to run, determine pass/fail and adjust other behavior using test\n\n# properties.  In this file, one can see the exact ``ADD_TEST()`` and\n\n# ``SET_TESTS_PROPERTIES()`` commands.  The is the ultimate way to debug\n\n# exactly what tests are getting added by this function (or if the test is\n\n# even being added at all).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Disabling Tests Externally (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Disabling Tests Externally (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# The test can be disabled externally by setting the CMake cache variable\n\n# ``<fullTestName>_DISABLE=TRUE``.  This allows tests to be disabled on a\n\n# case-by-case basis by the user (for whatever reason).  Here,\n\n# ``<fullTestName>`` must be the *exact* name that shows up in 'ctest -N' when\n\n# running the test.  If multiple tests are added in this function through\n\n# multiple argument sets to ``ARGS`` or through multiple\n\n# ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX>`` arguments, then ``<fullTestName>_DISABLE=TRUE``\n\n# must be set for each test individually.  When a test is disabled in this\n\n# way, TriBITS will always print a warning to the ``cmake`` stdout at\n\n# configure time warning that the test is being disabled.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Adding extra commandline arguments externally (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()):\n\n#\n\n# **Adding extra commandline arguments externally (TRIBITS_ADD_TEST())**\n\n#\n\n# One can add additional command-line arguments for any ctest test added using\n\n# this function.  In order to do so, set the CMake cache variable::\n\n#\n\n#   SET(<fullTestName>_EXTRA_ARGS  \"<earg0>;<earg1>;<earg2>;...\"\n\n#     CACHE  STRING  \"Extra args\")\n\n#\n\n# in a ``*.cmake`` configure options fragment file or::\n\n#\n\n#   -D <fullTestName>_EXTRA_ARGS=\"<earg0>;<earg1>;<earg2>;...\"\n\n#\n\n# on the CMake command-line.\n\n#\n\n# These extra command-line arguments are added after any arguments passed in\n\n# through ``ARGS \"<oarg0> <oarg1> ...\"`` or ``POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX> <oarg0>\n\n# <oarg1> ...``.  This allows these extra arguments to override the ealier\n\n# arguments.\n\n#\n\n# The primary motivating use case for ``<fullTestName>_EXTRA_ARGS`` is to\n\n# allow one to alter how a test runs on a specific platform or build.  For\n\n# example, this allows one to disable specific individual unit tests for a\n\n# GTest executable such as with::\n\n#\n\n#   SET(<fullTestName>_EXTRA_ARGS \"--gtest_filter=-<unittest0>:<unittest1>:...\"\n\n#     CACHE  STRING  \"Disable specific unit tests\" )  \n\n#\n\n# For example, this would be an alternative to disabling an entire unit\n\n# testing executable using ``-D<fullTestName>_DISABLE=ON`` as described above.\n\n#\n",

All of the contents of the\n\n#       subpackage should be under this subdirectory.  This is assumed by the\n\n#       TriBITS testing support software when mapping modified files to SE\n\n#       packages that need to be tested (see `checkin-test.py`_).\n\n#\n\n#     * **CLASSIFICATIONS** (Column 2): The `Test Test Category`_ `PT`_,\n\n#       `ST`_, `EX`_ and the maturity level ``EP``, ``RS``, ``PG``, ``PM``,\n\n#       ``GRS``, ``GPG``, ``GPM``, and ``UM``, separated by a coma ',' with no\n\n#       spaces in between (e.g. ``\"PT,GPM\"``).  These have exactly the same\n\n#       meaning as for full packages (see\n\n#       `TRIBITS_REPOSITORY_DEFINE_PACKAGES()`_).\n\n#\n\n#     * **OPTREQ** (Column 3): Determines if the outer parent package has an\n\n#       ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED`` dependence on this subpackage.\n\n#\n\n# Other variables that this macro handles:\n\n#\n\n#   ``REGRESSION_EMAIL_LIST``\n\n#\n\n#     The email list that is used to send CDash error messages.  If this\n\n#     argument is missing, then the email list that CDash errors go to is\n\n#     determined by other means (see `CDash regression email addresses`_).\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: All this macro really does is to just define the variables:\n\n#\n\n# * ``LIB_REQUIRED_DEP_PACKAGES``\n\n# * ``LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACKAGES``\n\n# * ``TEST_REQUIRED_DEP_PACKAGES``\n\n# * ``TEST_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACKAGES``\n\n# * ``LIB_REQUIRED_DEP_TPLS``\n\n# * ``LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_TPLS``\n\n# * ``TEST_REQUIRED_DEP_TPLS``\n\n# * ``TEST_OPTIONAL_DEP_TPLS``\n\n# * ``REGRESSION_EMAIL_LIST``\n\n# * ``SUBPACKAGES_DIRS_CLASSIFICATIONS_OPTREQS``\n\n#\n\n# which are then read by the TriBITS cmake code to build the SE package\n\n# dependency graph.  The advantage of using this macro instead of just\n\n# directly setting the variables is that an SE package only needs to list\n\n# dependencies that exist.  Otherwise, the ``Dependencies.cmake`` file will\n\n# need to set all of the above local variables, even those that are empty.\n\n# This is an error checking property of the TriBITS system to avoid misspelling\n\n# the names of these variables.\n\n#\n",

In every other case, a TriBITS TPL\n\n#     should be used instead.\n\n#\n\n#   ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED``\n\n#\n\n#     If ``STATIC`` is passed in, then a static library will be created\n\n#     independent of the value of ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.  If ``SHARED`` is\n\n#     passed in, then a shared library will be created independent of the\n\n#     value of ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.  If neither ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` are\n\n#     passed in, then a shared library will be created if\n\n#     ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` evaluates to true, otherwise and a static library\n\n#     will be created.  If both ``STATIC`` and ``SHARED`` are passed in (which\n\n#     is obviously a mistake), then a shared library will be created.\n\n#     WARNING: Once you mark a library with ``STATIC``, then all of the\n\n#     downstream libraries in the current SE package and all downstream SE\n\n#     packages must also be also be marked with ``STATIC``.  That is because,\n\n#     generally, one can not link a link a static lib against a downstream\n\n#     shared lib since that is not portable (but can be done on some platforms\n\n#     if, for example, ``-fPIC`` is specified).  So be careful to use\n\n#     ``STATIC`` in all downstream libraries!\n\n#\n\n#   ``TESTONLY``\n\n#\n\n#     If passed in, then ``<libTargetName>`` will **not** be added to\n\n#     ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBRARIES`` and an install target for the library will\n\n#     not be added.  In this case, the current include directories will be set\n\n#     in the global variable ``<libTargetName>_INCLUDE_DIR`` which will be\n\n#     used in `TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE()`_ when a test-only library is linked\n\n#     in through its ``DEPLIBS`` argument.\n\n#\n\n#   ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then no install targets will be added for the library\n\n#     ``<libTargetName>`` or the header files listed in ``HEADERS``.\n\n#\n\n#   ``CUDALIBRARY``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified then ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY()`` is used instead of\n\n#     ``ADD_LIBRARY()`` where ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY()`` is assumed to be defined\n\n#     by the standard ``FindCUDA.cmake`` module as processed using the\n\n#     standard TriBITS ``FindTPLCUDA.cmake`` file (see `Standard TriBITS\n\n#     TPLs`_).  For this option to work, this SE package must have an enabled\n\n#     direct or indirect dependency on the TriBITS CUDA TPL or a\n\n#     configure-time error may occur about not knowing about\n\n#     ``CUDA_ALL_LIBRARY()``.\n\n#\n\n#   ``ADDED_LIB_TARGET_NAME_OUT <libTargetName>``\n\n#\n\n#     If specified, then on output the variable ``<libTargetName>`` will be\n\n#     set with the name of the library passed to ``ADD_LIBRARY()``.  Having\n\n#     this name allows the calling ``CMakeLists.txt`` file access and set\n\n#     additional target properties (see `Additional Library and Source File\n\n#     Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())`_).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Include Directories (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):\n\n#\n\n# **Include Directories (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**\n\n#\n\n# Any base directories for the header files listed in the arguments\n\n# ``HEADERS`` or ``NOINSTALLHEADERS`` should be passed into the standard CMake\n\n# command ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()`` **before** calling this function.  For\n\n# example, a CMakeLists.txt file will look like::\n\n#\n\n#   ...\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_CONFIGURE_FILE(${PACKAGE_NAME}_config.h)\n\n#   CONFIGURE_FILE(...)\n\n#\n\n#   ...\n\n#\n\n#   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})\n\n#   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})\n\n#\n\n#   ...\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY( <libName>\n\n#     SOURCES\n\n#       <src0>.c\n\n#       <subdir0>/<src1>.cpp\n\n#       <subdir1>/<src2>.F90\n\n#       ...\n\n#     HEADERS\n\n#        <header0>.h\n\n#        <subdir0>/<header1>.hpp\n\n#         ...\n\n#     NONINSTALLHEADERS <header2>.hpp <header3>.hpp ...\n\n#     ...\n\n#     )\n\n#\n\n# The include of ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` is needed for any generated\n\n# header files (e.g. using raw ``CONFIGURE_FILE()`` or\n\n# `TRIBITS_CONFIGURE_FILE()`_) or any generated Fortran ``*.mod`` module files\n\n# generated as a byproduct of compiling F90+ source files (that contain one or\n\n# more Fortran module declarations).\n\n#\n\n# The function ``TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()`` will grab the list of all of the\n\n# include directories in scope from prior calls to ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()``\n\n# and will append these to the variable ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS``.\n\n# This list of include directories is exported to downstream SE packages so\n\n# they appear on the compile lines of all downstream object file compiles.\n\n# This is a critical part of the \"glue\" that allows TriBITS packages to link\n\n# up automatically (just by clearing dependencies in\n\n# `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_ files).\n\n#\n\n# .. _Install Targets (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):\n\n#\n\n# **Install Targets (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**\n\n#\n\n# By default, an install target for the library is created using\n\n# ``INSTALL(TARGETS <libTargetName> ...)`` to install into the directory\n\n# ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/`` (actual install directory is given by\n\n# ``${PROJECT}_INSTALL_LIB_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix at configure\n\n# time`_).  However, this install target will not get created if\n\n# `${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS`_ is ``FASLE`` and\n\n# ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=OFF``.  But when ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=ON``, the install\n\n# target will get added.  Also, this install target will *not* get added if\n\n# ``TESTONLY`` or ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are passed in.\n\n#\n\n# By default, an install target for the headers listed in ``HEADERS`` will get\n\n# added using ``INSTALL(FILES <h0> <h1> ...)``, but only if ``TESTONLY`` and\n\n# ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are not passed in as well.  Also, the install\n\n# target for the headers will not get added if\n\n# `${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS`_ is ``FASLE``.  If this\n\n# install target is added, then the headers get installed into the flat\n\n# directory ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/`` (default is\n\n# ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/``, see `Setting the install prefix at\n\n# configure time`_).  If ``HEADERS_INSTALL_SUBDIR`` is set, then the headers\n\n# will be installed under\n\n# ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/<headerssubdir>/``.\n\n#\n\n# Note that an install target will *not* get created for the headers listed in\n\n# ``NOINSTALLHEADERS``.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Additional Library and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):\n\n#\n\n# **Additional Library and Source File Properties (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**\n\n#\n\n# Once ``ADD_LIBRARY(<libTargetName> ... <src0> <src1> ...)`` is called, one\n\n# can set and change properties on the ``<libTargetName>`` library target\n\n# using the built-in CMake command ``SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES()`` as well as set\n\n# and change properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using\n\n# the built-in CMake command ``SET_SOURCE_FILE_PROPERTIES()`` just like in any\n\n# CMake project.  For example::\n\n#\n\n#   TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY( somelib ...\n\n#     ADDED_LIB_TARGET_NAME_OUT  somelib_TARGET_NAME )\n\n#\n\n#   SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES( ${somelib_TARGET_NAME}\n\n#     PROPERTIES  LINKER_LANGUAGE  CXX )\n\n#\n\n# .. _Miscellaneous Notes (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY()):\n\n#\n\n# **Miscellaneous Notes (TRIBITS_ADD_LIBRARY())**\n\n#\n\n# When the file ``Version.cmake`` exists and the CMake variables\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION`` and ``${PROJECT_NAME}_MAJOR_VERSION`` are\n\n# defined, then produced shared libraries will be given the standard SOVERSION\n\n# symlinks (see `<projectDir>/Version.cmake`_).\n\n#\n\n# **WARNING:** Do **NOT** use the built-in CMake command ``ADD_DEFINITIONS()``\n\n# to add defines ``-D<someDefine>`` to the compile command line that will\n\n# affect any of the header files in the package!

The 6 columns (ordered 0-5) are:\n\n#\n\n# 0. **REPO_NAME** (``<repoi_name>``): The name given to the repository\n\n#    ``REPOSITORY_NAME``.\n\n#\n\n# 1. **REPO_DIR** (``<repoi_dir>``): The relative directory for the repository\n\n#    under the project directory ``${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}`` (or\n\n#    ``<projectDir>``).  If this is set to empty quoted string ``\"\"``, then\n\n#    the relative directory name is assumed to be same as the repository name\n\n#    ``<repoi_name>``.  NOTE: If the repo is a `TriBITS Repository`_ (see\n\n#    ``REPO_PACKSTAT`` below) then, currently, the repo dir must be the same\n\n#    as the package name.\n\n#\n\n# 2. **REPO_VCTYPE** (``<repoi_vctype>``): The version control (VC) type of\n\n#    the repo.  Value choices include ``GIT``, ``SVN`` (i.e. Subversion) or\n\n#    empty ``\"\"`` (in which case ``<repoi_url>`` must be empty as well).\n\n#    WARNING: Only VC repos of type ``GIT`` can fully participate in the\n\n#    TriBITS development tool workflows.  The other VC types are only\n\n#    supported for basic cloning and updating using `TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`_\n\n#    scripts.\n\n#\n\n# 3. **REPO_URL** (``<repoi_url>``): The URL of the VC repo.  This info is\n\n#    used to initially obtain the repo source code using the VC tool listed in\n\n#    ``<repoi_vctype>``.  If the repo does not need to be cloned for the\n\n#    needed use cases, then this can be the empty quoted string ``\"\"``.  Also,\n\n#    this field must be the empty string ``\"\"`` if ``<repoi_vctype>`` is empty\n\n#    ``\"\"``.\n\n#\n\n# 4. **REPO_PACKSTAT** (``<repoi_packstat>``): Determines if the repository is\n\n#    a `TriBITS Repository`_ and contains any TriBITS packages (or if it just\n\n#    provides directories and files) and if its packages are listed before or\n\n#    after the project's own native packages.  If this is a TriBITS Repository\n\n#    (and therefore contains `TriBITS Repository Core Files`_) then this field\n\n#    must contain the keyword ``HASPACKAGES`` or left empty.  If the listed\n\n#    repository is **not** a TriBITS repository, and just provides directories\n\n#    and files, then this field must contain the keyword ``NOPACKAGES``.  The\n\n#    default is assumed to be ``HASPACKAGES`` if neither of these keywords are\n\n#    provided.  If the keyword ``PRE`` is provided, then the TriBITS packages\n\n#    in this repo come before the project's native packages.  If the keyword\n\n#    ``POST`` is provided then the packages are listed after the project's\n\n#    native packages. The default is assumed to be ``POST`` if neither of\n\n#    these keywords are provided.  The keywords must be separated by a comma\n\n#    with no spaces such as with \"``PRE,HASPACKAGES``\",\n\n#    \"``HASPACKAGES,POST``\", \"``POST,NOPACKAGES``\", etc.  If no keywords are\n\n#    provided, then the empty string \"\" must be used (which defaults to\n\n#    ``\"HASPACKAGES,POST\"``).\n\n#\n\n# 5. **REPO_CLASSIFICATION** (``<repoi_classif>``): Gives the `Repository Test\n\n#    Classification`_ which also happens to be the CTest/CDash testing mode\n\n#    and the default dashboard track.  Valid values are ``Continuous``,\n\n#    ``Nightly``, and ``Experimental``.  See `Repository Test Classification`_\n\n#    for a detailed description.\n\n#\n\n# This command is used to put together one or more VC and/or TriBITS\n\n# repositories to construct a composite `TriBITS Project`_.  The option\n\n# `<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`_ is used to point to files that call this macro.\n\n#\n\n# Repositories with ``<repoi_packstat>=NOPACKAGES`` are **not** TriBITS\n\n# Repositories and are technically not considered at all during the basic\n\n# configuration of the a TriBITS project.  They are only listed in this file\n\n# so that they can be used in the version control logic for tools that perform\n\n# version control with the repositories (such as getting git versions,\n\n# cloning, updating, looking for changed files, etc.).  For example, a\n\n# non-TriBITS repo can be used to grab a set of directories and files that\n\n# fill in the definition of a package in an upstream repository (see `How to\n\n# insert a package into an upstream repo`_).

If\n\n#   one misspells the name of a macro, it is an immediate error in CMake.  A\n\n#   misspelled set variable is just ignored.\n\n#\n\n# * The variable name can change in the future as an implementation detail.\n\n#\n",

This name\n\n#    must be unique across all other TriBITS packages in this or any other\n\n#    TriBITS repo that might be combined into a single TriBITS project\n\n#    meta-build (see `Globally unique TriBITS package names`_).  The name\n\n#    should be a valid identifier (e.g. matches the regex\n\n#    ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*``).  The package names tend to use mixed case\n\n#    (e.g. ```SomePackge`` not ``SOMEPACKGE``).\n\n#\n\n# 1. **DIR** (``<pkgi_dir>``): The relative directory for the package\n\n#    ``<packageDir>``.  This directory is relative to the TriBITS repository\n\n#    base directory ``<repoDir>``.  Under this directory will be a\n\n#    package-specific ``cmake/`` directory with the file\n\n#    `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_ and a base-level\n\n#    `<packageDir>/CMakeLists.txt`_ file.  The entire contents of the package\n\n#    including all of the source code and all of the tests should be contained\n\n#    under this directory.  The TriBITS testing infrastructure relies on the\n\n#    mapping of changed files to these base directories when deciding what\n\n#    packages are modified and need to be retested (along with downstream\n\n#    packages).  For details, see `checkin-test.py`_.\n\n#\n\n# 2. **CLASSIFICATION** (``<pkgi_classif>``): Gives the `SE Package Test\n\n#    Group`_ `PT`_, `ST`_, or `EX`_ and the maturity level ``EP``, ``RS``,\n\n#    ``PG``, ``PM``, ``GRS``, ``GPG``, ``GPM``, ``UM``.  These are separated\n\n#    by a coma with no space in between such as ``\"RS,PT\"`` for a \"Research\n\n#    Stable\", \"Primary Tested\" package.  No spaces are allowed so that CMake\n\n#    treats this a one field in the array.  The maturity level can be left off\n\n#    in which case it is assumed to be ``UM`` for \"Unspecified Maturity\".\n\n#    This classification for individual packages can be changed to ``EX`` for\n\n#    specific platforms by calling `TRIBITS_DISABLE_PACKAGE_ON_PLATFORMS()`_.\n\n#\n\n# **IMPORTANT:** The packages must be listed in increasing order of package\n\n# dependencies.  That is `No circular dependencies of any kind are allowed`_\n\n# (see the *ADP (Acyclic Dependencies Principle)* in `Software Engineering\n\n# Packaging Principles`_).  Package ``i`` can only list dependencies (in\n\n# `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_) for packages listed before this\n\n# package in this list (or in upstream TriBITS repositories).  This avoids an\n\n# expensive package sorting algorithm and makes it easy to flag packages with\n\n# circular dependencies or misspelling of package names.\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: For some rare use cases, the package directory ``<pkgi_dir>`` is\n\n# allowed to be specified as an absolute directory but this absolute directory\n\n# must be a subdirectory of the project source base directory given by\n\n# `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`_.  If not, ``MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR ...)`` is called and\n\n# processing stops immediately.\n\n#\n\n# NOTE: This macro just sets the variable::\n\n#\n\n#   ${REPOSITORY_NAME}_PACKAGES_AND_DIRS_AND_CLASSIFICATIONS\n\n#\n\n# in the current scope.  The advantages of using this macro instead of\n\n# directly setting this variable are that the macro:\n\n#\n\n# * Asserts that the variable ``REPOSITORY_NAME`` is defined and set\n\n#\n\n# * Avoids having to hard-code the assumed repository name\n\n#   ``${REPOSITORY_NAME}``.  This provides more flexibility for how other\n\n#   TriBITS projects choose to name a given TriBITS repo (i.e. the name of\n\n#   repo subdirs).\n\n#\n\n# * Avoid misspelling the name of the variable\n\n#   ``${REPOSITORY_NAME}_PACKAGES_AND_DIRS_AND_CLASSIFICATIONS``.  If one\n\n#   misspells the name of the macro, it is an immediate error in CMake.\n\n#\n",

What it does is to\n\n# allow one to create one's own user-defined keyword-based macros and\n\n# functions like is used by some built-in CMake commands.\n\n#\n\n# For example, consider the following user-defined macro that uses both\n\n# positional and keyword-based arguments using ``PARSE_ARGUMENTS()``::\n\n#\n\n#   MACRO(PARSE_SPECIAL_VARS  BASE_NAME)\n\n#\n\n#     PARSE_ARGUMENTS(\n\n#       #prefix\n\n#       ${BASE_NAME}\n\n#       #lists\n\n#       \"ARG0;ARG1;ARG2\"\n\n#       #options\n\n#       \"OPT0;OPT1\"\n\n#       ${ARGN}\n\n#       )\n\n#\n\n#   ENDMACRO()\n\n#\n\n# Calling this macro as::\n\n#\n\n#   PARSE_SPECIAL_VARS(MyVar ARG0 a b ARG2 c OPT1)\n\n#\n\n# sets the following variables in the current scope::\n\n#\n\n#   MyVar_ARG0=\"a;b\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG1=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG2=\"c\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT0=\"FALSE\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT1=\"TRUE\"\n\n#\n\n# This allows one to define user-defined macros and functions that have a\n\n# mixture of positional arguments and keyword-based arguments like one can do\n\n# in other languages.  The keyword-based arguments can be passed in any order\n\n# and those that are missing are empty (or false for options) by default.\n\n#\n\n# Any initial arguments that are not recognized as ``<argNamesList>`` or\n\n# ``<optionNamesList>`` keyword arguments will be put into the local variable\n\n# ``<prefix>_DEFAULT_ARGS``.  If no arguments in ``<inputArgsList>``\n\n# (typically ``${ARGN}``) match any in ``<argNamesList>``, then all non-option\n\n# arguments are put into ``<prefix>_DEFAULT_ARGS``.  For example, if one\n\n# passes in::\n\n#\n\n#   PARSE_SPECIAL_VARS(MyVar ARG5 a b c)\n\n#\n\n# you will get::\n\n#\n\n#   MyVar_DEFAULT_ARGS=\"ARG5;a;b;c\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG0=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG1=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG2=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT0=\"FALSE\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT1=\"FALSE\"\n\n#\n\n# Multiple occurrences of keyword arguments in ``<inputArgsList>`` is allowed\n\n# but only the last one listed will be recorded.  For example, if one calls::\n\n#\n\n#   PARSE_SPECIAL_VARS(MyVar ARG1 a b ARG1 c)\n\n#\n\n# then this will set::\n\n#\n\n#   MyVar_ARG0=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG1=\"c\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG2=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT0=\"FALSE\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT1=\"FALSE\"\n\n#\n\n# This is actually consistent with the way that most argument list parsers\n\n# behave with respect to multiple instances of the same argument so hopefully\n\n# this will not be a surprise to anyone.\n\n#\n\n# If one puts an option keyword in the middle of a keyword argument list, the\n\n# option keyword will get pulled out of the list.  For example, if one calls::\n\n#\n\n#   PARSE_SPECIAL_VARS(MyVar ARG0 a OPT0 c)\n\n#\n\n# then this will set::\n\n#\n\n#   MyVar_ARG0=\"a;c\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG1=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_ARG2=\"\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT0=\"TRUE\"\n\n#   MyVar_OPT1=\"FALSE\"\n\n#\n\n# This is confusing behavior so users would be smart not to mix option\n\n# arguments inside of list arguments.\n\n#\n\n# If ``PARSE_ARGUMENTS_DUMP_OUTPUT_ENABLED`` is set to ``TRUE``, then a bunch\n\n# of detailed debug info will be printed.  This should only be used in the\n\n# most desperate of debug situations because it will print a *lot* of output!\n\n#\n\n# **PERFORMANCE:** This function will scale as::\n\n#\n\n#   O( (len(<argNamesList>) * len(<optionNamesList>)) * len(<inputArgsList>) )\n\n#\n\n# Therefore, this could scale very badly for large sets of argument and option\n\n# names and input argument list names.\n\n#\n",

If ``FALSE`` then ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()``, ``CTEST_BUILD()`` and\n\n#     ``CTEST_TEST()`` and ``CTEST_SUBMIT()`` are called in a loop, once for\n\n#     each package to be explicitly tested. \n\n#\n\n# Both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package mode should produce\n\n# equivalent builds of the project and submits to CDash (for correctly\n\n# constructed TriBITS projects and packages).  But the package-by-package mode\n\n# will disable packages with failing library builds when processing downstream\n\n# packages, and therefore reduce the propagation of failures to downstream\n\n# packages and therefore is more robust.  But the package-by-package mode is\n\n# more expensive in several respects for many projects.\n\n#\n\n# For versions of CMake 3.10.0 and above and newer versions of CDash, the\n\n# CDash server for the all-at-once mode will break down build and test results\n\n# on a package-by-package basis on CDash together.\n\n#\n\n# **NOTE:** It has been confirmed that older versions of CDash can accept and\n\n# display results from newer CMake/CTest versions when\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES`` set to ``TRUE``.  It is just\n\n# that for older versions of CDash that it will not break down results on a\n\n# package-by-package basis on CDash and all of the build warnings and errors\n\n# and tests will be all globed together on CDash.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Mutiple ctest -S invocations (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):\n\n#\n\n# **Mutiple ctest -S invocations (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**\n\n#\n\n# By default, this function is meant to be used in a single invocation of the\n\n# ``ctest -S <script>.cmake`` command in order to do everything from the\n\n# beginning and submit to CDash.  But there are times when one needs to do the\n\n# various steps in multiple ``ctest -S`` invocations that all send data to the\n\n# same CDash build.  For example, on some clusters, configure and build must\n\n# be done on \"compile nodes\" but the tests must be run on \"compute nodes\".\n\n# Typically, these types of machines have a shared file system.  On a system\n\n# like this, one would use two different invocations as::\n\n#\n\n#   # Start new dashboard, update, configure, and build on compile node\n\n#   env CTEST_DO_TEST=OFF \\\n\n#     ctest -S <script>.cmake\n\n#\n\n#   # Run tests only on compute node\n\n#   <run-on-compute-node> \\\n\n#     env CTEST_DO_NEW_START=OFF CTEST_DO_UPDATES=OFF \\\n\n#       CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE=OFF CTEST_DO_BUILD=OFF \\\n\n#       CTEST_DO_TEST=ON \\\n\n#     ctest -S <script>.cmake\n\n#\n\n# Above, `CTEST_DO_NEW_START`_ ``= OFF`` is needed to ensure that the test\n\n# results go to the same CDash build.  (NOTE: A CDash build is uniquely\n\n# determined by the site name, build name and build stamp.)\n\n#\n\n# This approach works for both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package\n\n# mode.\n\n#\n\n# Also, one can run each of the basic steps in its own ``ctest -S`` invocation\n\n# starting with ``CTEST_DO_NEW_START = ON``, then `CTEST_DO_UPDATES`_ ``=\n\n# ON``, then `CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE`_ ``= ON``, then `CTEST_DO_BUILD`_ ``= ON``,\n\n# then then `CTEST_DO_TEST`_ ``= ON``, etc.  While there is typically no\n\n# reason to split things up to this level of granularity, CTest and this\n\n# ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` function will support such usage.  All that is\n\n# required is that those steps be performed in that order.  For example, one\n\n# cannot do a build in one ``ctest -S`` invocation and then try to do a\n\n# configure in the next because the build will fail because a valid\n\n# configuration has not been performed yet.

For example, this should be set to\n\n#    ``FALSE`` when running against a local development repo (e.g. the `make\n\n#    dashboard`_ target sets this to ``FALSE`` automatically) or when other\n\n#    logic is used to setup the source directories. **WARNING:** If you are\n\n#    running against a local repo with local changes and you don't set to\n\n#    ``FALSE``, then your local uncommitted changes will be wiped out and the\n\n#    local branch will be hard reset to the remote tracking branch!

Therefore, a newer version of\n\n# git is required when using named branches.\n\n#\n\n# The command ``git clone -fdx`` removes any untracked ignored files that may\n\n# have been created since the last update (either by the build process or by\n\n# someone messing around in that local git repository).  The command ``git\n\n# reset --hard HEAD`` removes any untracked non-ignored files, any modified\n\n# tracked files, and sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current ``HEAD``.  This sets\n\n# ``ORIG_HEAD`` after the initial clone (which is needed since ``ORIG_HEAD``\n\n# is not set after the initial ``git clone`` command).  This allows using the\n\n# range ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` with ``git diff`` and ``git log`` commands even\n\n# after the initial clone.  (Directly after the initial clone, the range\n\n# ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` will be empty). The git commands ``git checkout -B\n\n# <branch> <remote>/<branch>`` or ``git reset --hard @{u}`` are used to update\n\n# the local repo to match the remote tracking branch.  This is done to deal\n\n# with a possible forced push of the remote tracking branch or even changing\n\n# to different tracking branch (when using an explicit ``<branch>`` name).\n\n#\n\n# Note that the repository updating approach described above using non-empty\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is more robust, because it can recover from a\n\n# state where someone may have put a repo on a detached head or checked out a\n\n# different branch.  One of these repos might get into this state when a\n\n# person is messing around in the Nightly build and source directories to try\n\n# to figure out what happened and forgot to put the repos back on the correct\n\n# tracking branch.  Therefore, it is recommended to always set an explicit\n\n# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` to a non-null value like ``master`` or\n\n# ``develop`` for the git repos, even if this branch is the default repo\n\n# branch.\n\n#\n\n# .. _Other CTest Driver options (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):\n\n#\n\n# **Other CTest Driver options (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**\n\n#\n\n# Other miscellaneous vars that can be set in the CTest -S script or as env\n\n# vars are given below.\n\n#\n\n#   .. _CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR:\n\n#\n\n#   ``CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR=\"[Unix Makefiles|Ninja|..]\"``\n\n#\n\n#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the CMake generator used in the\n\n#     inner configure.

It does not implement *all* of the\n\n# standard XSDK configuration parameters.  The parent CMake project must do\n\n# that.\n\n#\n\n# Note that when USE_XSDK_DEFAULTS=TRUE, then the Fortran flags will be read\n\n# from either of the env vars FFLAGS or FCFLAGS.  If both are set, but are the\n\n# same, then FFLAGS it used (which is the same as FCFLAGS).  However, if both\n\n# are set but are not equal, then a FATAL_ERROR is raised and CMake configure\n\n# processing is stopped.\n\n#\n\n# To be used in a parent project, this module must be included after\n\n#\n\n#   PROJECT(${PROJECT_NAME}  NONE)\n\n#\n\n# is called but before the compilers are defined and processed using:\n\n#\n\n#   ENABLE_LANGUAGE(<LANG>)\n\n#\n\n# For example, one would do:\n\n#\n\n#   PROJECT(${PROJECT_NAME}  NONE)\n\n#   ...\n\n#   SET(USE_XSDK_DEFAULTS_DEFAULT TRUE) # Set to false if desired\n\n#   INCLUDE(\"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/stdk/XSDKDefaults.cmake\")\n\n#   ...\n\n#   ENABLE_LANGUAGE(C)\n\n#   ENABLE_LANGUAGE(C++)\n\n#   ENABLE_LANGUAGE(Fortran)\n\n#\n\n# The variable `USE_XSDK_DEFAULTS_DEFAULT` is used as the default for the\n\n# cache var `USE_XSDK_DEFAULTS`.  That way, a project can decide if it wants\n\n# XSDK defaults turned on or off by default and users can independently decide\n\n# if they want the CMake project to use standard XSDK behavior or raw CMake\n\n# behavior.\n\n#\n\n# By default, the XSDKDefaults.cmake module assumes that the project will need\n\n# C, C++, and Fortran.  If any language is not needed then, set\n\n# XSDK_ENABLE_C=OFF, XSDK_ENABLE_CXX=OFF, or XSDK_ENABLE_Fortran=OFF *before*\n\n# including this module.  Note, these variables are *not* cache vars because a\n\n# project either does or does not have C, C++ or Fortran source files, the\n\n# user has nothing to do with this so there is no need for cache vars.  The\n\n# parent CMake project just needs to tell XSDKDefault.cmake what languages is\n\n# needs or does not need.\n\n#\n\n# For example, if the parent CMake project only needs C, then it would do:\n\n#\n\n#   PROJECT(${PROJECT_NAME}  NONE)'\n\n#   ...\n\n#   SET(USE_XSDK_DEFAULTS_DEFAULT TRUE)\n\n#   SET(XSDK_ENABLE_CXX OFF)\n\n#   SET(XSDK_ENABLE_Fortran OFF)\n\n#   INCLUDE(\"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/stdk/XSDKDefaults.cmake\")\n\n#   ...\n\n#   ENABLE_LANGAUGE(C)\n\n#\n\n# This module code will announce when it sets any variables.\n\n#\n",

We recommend that you set CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS to OFF.\n\n# Otherwise, CMake defaults to using extensions for the C++ standard, and the\n\n# GNU extensions (-std=gnu++11) will be used for compilers that support it\n\n# instead of standard C++11 (-std=c++11).\n\n#\n\n# A bunch of build options are added as variables (all starting with KOKKOS_)\n\n# to the build.
