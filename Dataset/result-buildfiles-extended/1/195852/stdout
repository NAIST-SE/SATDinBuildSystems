In other words, the library implements all the\n\n#     interface numbers in the range from number current - age to current. \n\n# If two libraries have identical current and age numbers, then the dynamic\n\n# linker chooses the library with the greater revision number. \n\n#\n\n# the USENIX paper `Library Interface Versioning in Solaris and Linux'\n\n# <http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/als00/2000papers/papers/full_papers/browndavid/browndavid.pdf>,\n\n# and for library incompatibilities, see\n\n# <http://www.dwheeler.com/program-library/Program-Library-HOWTO/x36.html#AEN137>.\n\n#\n\n# To quote the libtool manual:\n\n#\n\n# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version\n\n# information:\n\n#\n\n#   1. Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool\n\n#   library.\n\n#\n\n#   2. Update the version information only immediately before a public\n\n#   release of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary,\n\n#   and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger\n\n#   faster.\n\n#\n\n#   3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last\n\n#   update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).\n\n#\n\n#   4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since\n\n#   the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.\n\n#\n\n#   5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public\n\n#   release, then increment age.\n\n#\n\n#   6. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last\n\n#   public release, then set age to 0.\n\n#\n\n# Never try to set the interface numbers so that they correspond to\n\n# the release number of your package. This is an abuse that only\n\n# fosters misunderstanding of the purpose of library\n\n# versions. Instead, use the -release flag (see Release numbers), but\n\n# be warned that every release of your package will not be binary\n\n# compatible with any other release.\n\n#\n\n# The following explanation may help to understand the above rules a\n\n# bit better: consider that there are three possible kinds of\n\n# reactions from users of your library to changes in a shared library:\n\n#\n\n#   1. Programs using the previous version may use the new version as\n\n#   drop-in replacement, and programs using the new version can also\n\n#   work with the previous one. In other words, no recompiling nor\n\n#   relinking is needed. In this case, bump revision only, don't touch\n\n#   current nor age.\n\n#\n\n#   2. Programs using the previous version may use the new version as\n\n#   drop-in replacement, but programs using the new version may use\n\n#   APIs not present in the previous one. In other words, a program\n\n#   linking against the new version may fail with “unresolved symbols”\n\n#   if linking against the old version at runtime: set revision to 0,\n\n#   bump current and age.\n\n#\n\n#   3. Programs may need to be changed, recompiled, relinked in order\n\n#   to use the new version. Bump current, set revision and age to 0.\n\n#\n",
