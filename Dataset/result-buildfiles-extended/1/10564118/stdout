The testsuite module has a small number of submodules:\n\n    integration - holds all integration tests for Wildfly.\n    compat      - holds all compatibility management tests for Wildfly.\n    domain      - holds all domain management tests for Wildfly.\n\n    All tests should fit into one of these four categories.\n\n    2. This pom is inherited by all submodules and should be used to do the following:\n       - Set defaults for common testsuite system properties (which can then be overridden on the command line).\n       - Define dependencies common to all tests (Arquillian, junit or testng, and container type).\n       - Provide a workaround for @Resource(lookup=...) which requires libraries in jbossas/endorsed.\n       - Define a default server configuration installed into target/jboasas in each submodule, which\n         represents an unmodified copy of the AS server. Custom server configurations are defined in the submodules.\n       - Define profiles to allow selection of which test modules will be executed.\n\n    3. This pom should not be used to do the following:\n       - Define module-specific server configuration build steps.\n       - Define module-specific surefire executions.\n       These elements should be defined in logical profiles associated with each logical grouping of tests,\n       in the pom for the module which contains the tests. See the submodule poms for more details.\n\n",
