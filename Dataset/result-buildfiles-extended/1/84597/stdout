According to this using -W flag should be safe (as gcc is\n\n# backward compatlible) but using -Wextra is limited to newer gcc releases.\n\n#\n\n# Attached patch replaces all -Wextra occurences with -W and thus fixes\n\n# compliation failures with older gcc (mine was gcc-3.3.3 on sles).\n\n#\n\n# patch by Cyril Hrubis\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.12  2009/10/09 17:55:48  yaberauneya\n\n# 1. Please see README.mk-devel for a full description of the changes\n\n# from a Make perspective.\n\n# 2. Several files were changed to accomodate correct installation\n\n# practices, most notably ones in testcases/network/{ipv6,tcp_cmds},\n\n# testcases/kernel/sched/hyperthreading/ht_enabled/..., and some items\n\n# in tools/..., and also to avoid collisions as far as installed\n\n# testcases (scripts, compiled C apps) were concerned.\n\n# 3. Several apps weren't autoconf safe and some autoconf tests and\n\n# conditional statements have been placed in sourcecode and in Makefiles\n\n# to either a) prevent the tests from being built / installed or b) turn\n\n# the tests into dummy apps which print out TCONF messages due to\n\n# lack-of-build support.\n\n#\n\n# Signed-off-by: Ngie Cooper <yaneurabeya@gmail.com>\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.11  2008/02/14 08:22:22  subrata_modak\n\n# Disktest application update to version 1.4.2, by, Brent Yardley <yardleyb@us.ibm.com>\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.31  2008/02/07 15:43:37  yardleyb\n\n# Applied patch from Mike Frysinger to ensure Makefile properly respect CFLAGS/LDFLAGS\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.30  2006/10/19 20:01:48  yardleyb\n\n# changes made to support rpm builds\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.29  2006/10/19 17:30:27  yardleyb\n\n# Added basic signal handling.\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.28  2006/05/12 19:44:47  yardleyb\n\n# added CHANGELOG to distro\n\n# uninstall does not force a build\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.27  2005/10/12 23:13:35  yardleyb\n\n# Updates to code to support new function in disktest version 1.3.x.\n\n# Actual changes are recorded in the README\n\n#\n\n# Revision 1.26  2004/12/18 06:13:03  yardleyb\n\n# Updated timer schema to more accurately use the time options.
