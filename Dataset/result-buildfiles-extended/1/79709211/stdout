These targets are usually executed \n    before and after some main targets. They are: \n\n      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties\n      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties\n      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation\n      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation\n      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file\n      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file\n      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test\n      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test\n      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building\n      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building\n      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products\n\n    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)\n\n    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"-post-compile\">\n            <obfuscate>\n                <fileset dir=\"${build.classes.dir}\"/>\n            </obfuscate>\n        </target>\n\n    For list of available properties check the imported \n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n\n    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.\n    The targets of interest are: \n\n      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation\n      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution\n      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging\n      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution\n      -do-jar:                  JAR building\n      run:                      execution of project \n      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation\n      test-report:              JUnit report generation\n\n    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"run\" depends=\"SanityTests-impl.jar\">\n            <exec dir=\"bin\" executable=\"launcher.exe\">\n                <arg file=\"${dist.jar}\"/>\n            </exec>\n        </target>\n\n    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on \n    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available \n    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the\n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n    ",
