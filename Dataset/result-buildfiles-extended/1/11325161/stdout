Note that versions starting \n        with 0.x.x are considered pre-release, ie. 0.MAJOR.MINOR.\n        \n        MAJOR: A breaking (ie. backwards-incompatible) change to the public API of the library\n               eg. Removing or modifying a public or protected method in a class\n        MINOR: A backwards-compatible change to the public API\n               eg. Adding a new method to a class, or adding a new class\n        PATCH: An improvement that doesn't affect the public API\n               eg. A refactor, performance improvement, or bugfix\n        \n        We won't go to 1.x.x until we have a high degree of confidence that\n        future backwards-compatible changes to the API will be rare.\n        \n        Please read http://semver.org/ if you haven't already.\n        \n    2)  When you increase the version you must create a new Github release for this\n        version.  This will trigger an automatic regeneration of the Maven repository\n        using the http://jitpack.io/ service.\n     \n    3)  Note that the index.html page on http://quickml.org/ should update the version\n        automatically when a new release is created.\n        \n    4)  *ANY* change to the master branch (ie. when a feature branch is merged) must\n        be accompanied by a bump in version number, regardless of how minor the change.\n   0.10.1 ",
