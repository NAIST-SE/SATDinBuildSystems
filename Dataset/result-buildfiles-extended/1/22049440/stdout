Note that clean is not part of the install lifecycle, so it\n                    must be run explicitly. This is don on purpose so that we do not re-run npm install all the\n                    time as it takes too long.\n\n                    Second phase is the app build which is also performed by npm using \"npm run build.dev\". This\n                    is what actually buids the application (Also this is what is run when you do \"npm start\").\n\n                    Therefore the general development process is (build from command line):\n                    1. mvn clean - to perform npm install and load all the heavy files in node_modules\n                    2. mvn process-sources - to perform the build.dev on npm (Note that this phase is picked up by\n                                             normal mvn install)\n\n                    When developing you should run \"npm start\" which listens for the changes and auto compiles all\n                    javascript and put it into target directory (i.e. dist/dev).\n\n                    This concludes the NodeJS part.\n\n                    The JAM part is now simple is uses \"src/main/typescript/node_modules\" and \"src/main/typescript/dist/dev\"\n                    as additional webresources, so maven war plugin can include these when packaging war file.\n\n                    When running JAM via IDE (e.g. Intellij) you will need to run extra tasks from command line to update\n                    the javascript that was recompiled by npm. \"mvn validate -Pnodejs\" this copies \"dist/dev\" to\n                    \"jam/target/yes-manager/resources\"\n            ",
