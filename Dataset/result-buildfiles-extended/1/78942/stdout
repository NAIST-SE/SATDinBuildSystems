        "Text" : "#.rst:\n\n# FindCUDA\n\n# --------\n\n#\n\n# GROMACS developers README\n\n# -------------------------\n\n#\n\n# This file is taken from CMake git tag v.3.4.3 Modules/FindCUDA.cmake\n\n# and modified to use --include-path and --system-include for the\n\n# include paths required for nvcc to function. Those are the supported\n\n# flags for nvcc, so should continue to function. Several other\n\n# supporting cmake files from Modules/FindCUDA/*cmake are also\n\n# required, and these are also copied from the CMake repo, unmodified.\n\n#\n\n# The main file is modified further to make\n\n# FindPackageHandleStandardArgs able to find those required supporting\n\n# cmake files.\n\n#\n\n# Once CMake 3.7.0 is required for GROMACS, then the fix for CMake\n\n# issue #14201 contained therein may remove the need for GROMACS to\n\n# import these files. Or CMake 3.8 supports CUDA natively (but 3.9\n\n# required for MSVC support also) if that proves useful for\n\n# GROMACS. However, the FindCUDA.cmake in CMake 3.9.0 still does not\n\n# use include functionality for headers internal to CUDA that would\n\n# permit the GROMACS use of -Wundef to lead to warning-free CUDA\n\n# compilation.\n\n#\n\n# Standard FindCUDA documentation\n\n# -------------------------------\n\n#\n\n# Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.\n\n#\n\n# This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools.  It should work on linux,\n\n# windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C\n\n# releases.\n\n#\n\n# This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of\n\n# <VERSION>, REQUIRED and QUIET.  CUDA_FOUND will report if an\n\n# acceptable version of CUDA was found.\n\n#\n\n# The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if\n\n# the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system\n\n# path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package().  To use a different\n\n# installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable\n\n# CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g.\n\n# CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default\n\n# /usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.  If\n\n# you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that\n\n# depend on the path will be relocated.\n\n#\n\n# It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on certain\n\n# platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed in the default\n\n# location.  In newer versions of the toolkit the cuda library is\n\n# included with the graphics driver- be sure that the driver version\n\n# matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.\n\n#\n\n# The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the\n\n# script (in alphebetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be\n\n# changed multiple times in the same directory before calling\n\n# CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX,\n\n# CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN, CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS::\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)\n\n#   -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.\n\n#      Note that making this different from the host code when generating object\n\n#      or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by\n\n#      nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the\n\n#      file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)\n\n#   -- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source\n\n#      file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple\n\n#      targets.\n\n#\n\n#      This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad\n\n#      things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.\n\n#      When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build\n\n#      command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build\n\n#      errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a\n\n#      source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.\n\n#      When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on\n\n#      the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user\n\n#      is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if\n\n#      this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets\n\n#      and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)\n\n#   -- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in\n\n#      Device mode.

This helps make the\n\n#      generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes\n\n#      certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag\n\n#      propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc\n\n#      via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through\n\n#      CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.

When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the\n\n#      nvcc_flags passed in are the same as the flags passed in via the OPTIONS\n\n#      argument.  The only nvcc flag added automatically is the bitness flag as\n\n#      specified by CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE.  Note that this is a function\n\n#      instead of a macro.\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...\n\n#                    [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )\n\n#   -- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,\n\n#      CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this\n\n#      function under the hood.\n\n#\n\n#      Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates\n\n#      custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use \"PTX\" or\n\n#      \"OBJ\" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don't end with .cu\n\n#      or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.\n\n#\n\n#      The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to\n\n#      give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by\n\n#      specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General\n\n#      options must preceed configuration specific options.  Not all\n\n#      configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.\n\n#\n\n#         OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 \"-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag\"\n\n#         DEBUG -g\n\n#         RELEASE --use_fast_math\n\n#         RELWITHDEBINFO --use_fast_math;-g\n\n#         MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math\n\n#\n\n#      For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with\n\n#      CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will\n\n#      be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the\n\n#      cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file\n\n#      and will link in the resulting object file automatically.\n\n#\n\n#      This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at\n\n#      build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.\n\n#\n\n#        1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses\n\n#        Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now\n\n#        checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.\n\n#\n\n#        2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it\n\n#        encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the\n\n#        target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script\n\n#        now deletes the output files if there was an error.\n\n#\n\n#        3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then\n\n#        make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be\n\n#        regenerated when the options change.\n\n#\n\n#      This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to\n\n#      determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.\n\n#      BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in\n\n#      CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building\n\n#      objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,\n\n#      <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is\n\n#      detected.\n\n#\n\n#      Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are passed along to nvcc.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n# The script defines the following variables::\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    -- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.\n\n#   CUDA_VERSION_MINOR    -- The minor version.\n\n#   CUDA_VERSION\n\n#   CUDA_VERSION_STRING   -- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR\n\n#\n\n#   CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).\n\n#   CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR     -- Path to the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the\n\n#                            SDK.  This script will not directly support finding\n\n#                            specific libraries or headers, as that isn't\n\n#                            supported by NVIDIA.  If you want to change\n\n#                            libraries when the path changes see the\n\n#                            FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear\n\n#                            these variables.  There are also examples of how to\n\n#                            use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or\n\n#                            libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).\n\n#   CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS     -- Include directory for cuda headers.

It adds a few convenience features:\n\n#   - Adds file-level dependencies between custom targets added with this\n\n#     command such that if there is a target-level dependency, it also implies\n\n#     that the custom command should always be run if the output file of the\n\n#     dependency has been updated.\n\n#   - Support for creating custom targets that produce stamp files whenever\n\n#     they run successfully, so that other targets can depend on those stamp\n\n#     files.\n\n#\n\n# Usage:\n\n#   gmx_add_custom_output_target(<target> [RUN_ALWAYS] [ADD_FAST_TARGET]\n\n#                                OUTPUT <STAMP | <output> >\n\n#                                [COMMAND <command1> [<args1...>]]\n\n#                                [COMMAND <command2> [<args2...>]]\n\n#                                [WORKING_DIRECTORY <dir>]\n\n#                                [DEPENDS <deps...>]\n\n#                                [DEPENDS_FILE_LIST <list>]\n\n#                                [COMMENT <comment>] [USES_TERMINAL])\n\n#\n\n#   <target>\n\n#     - Name of the custom target to create.\n\n#   RUN_ALWAYS\n\n#     - Create the command such that it always runs, and may update the output\n\n#       file in the process.\n\n#       The dependencies listed with DEPENDS are ignored in this case.\n\n#   ADD_FAST_TARGET\n\n#     - In addition to creating <target>, create a secondary target\n\n#       <target>-fast that always runs the same commands, but does not have\n\n#       any dependencies.  Desired dependencies can be added separately using\n\n#       add_dependencies().  This supports cases where some of the dependencies\n\n#       are time-consuming to build, and it is possible to build the target\n\n#       even without up-to-date dependencies for testing only that part of the\n\n#       build.\n\n#   OUTPUT\n\n#     - Sets the name of the output file from this custom target.\n\n#       Can be set to STAMP, in which case a stamp file name is automatically\n\n#       generated and commands to touch that stamp whenever the target is made\n\n#       are added.\n\n#   COMMAND\n\n#     - Passed to add_custom_command()/add_custom_target().\n\n#       If OUTPUT STAMP is used, then a command to touch the stamp is\n\n#       automatically added.  In this case, it is allowed to not specify any\n\n#       commands explicitly.\n\n#   WORKING_DIRECTORY\n\n#     - Passed to add_custom_command()/add_custom_target()\n\n#   COMMENT\n\n#     - Passed to add_custom_command()/add_custom_target()\n\n#   USES_TERMINAL\n\n#     - Passed to add_custom_command()/add_custom_target()\n\n#   DEPENDS\n\n#     - Dependencies passed to add_custom_command().  Any targets in this list\n\n#       that have been created with gmx_add_custom_output_target() are\n\n#       automatically expanded such that the custom command always runs if the\n\n#       output of the dependent target changes.

This mechanism is not quite enough\n\n#       for building a tarball, but setting the CMake cache variable\n\n#       GMX_BUILD_TARBALL=on will suppress the addition of \"-dev\" to the\n\n#       version string.\n\n#   LIBRARY_SOVERSION_MAJOR so major version for the built libraries.\n\n#       Should be increased for each binary incompatible release. In GROMACS,\n\n#       the typical policy is to increase it at the start of the development\n\n#       cycle for each major/minor version change, but not for patch releases,\n\n#       even if the latter may not always be fully binary compatible.\n\n#       Table of historical values\n\n#         GROMACS     5.0    0\n\n#         GROMACS     5.1    1\n\n#         GROMACS     2016   2\n\n#         GROMACS     2018   3\n\n#         GROMACS     2019   4\n\n#         GROMACS     2020   5\n\n#   LIBRARY_SOVERSION_MINOR so minor version for the built libraries.\n\n#       Should be increased for each release that changes only the implementation.\n\n#       In GROMACS, the typical policy is to increase it for each patch version\n\n#       change, even if they may not always be fully binary compatible.\n\n#       If it is somehow clear that the ABI implementation has not changed\n\n#       in a patch release, this variable should not increase. Release candidate\n\n#       and beta versions will not increase this number, since nobody should\n\n#       write code against such versions.\n\n#   LIBRARY_VERSION        Full library version.\n\n#   REGRESSIONTEST_BRANCH  For builds not from source packages, name of the\n\n#       regressiontests branch at gerrit.gromacs.org whose HEAD can test this\n\n#       code, *if* this code is recent enough (i.e., contains all changes from\n\n#       the corresponding code branch that affects the regression test\n\n#       results). Even after a release branch is forked for the source\n\n#       repository, the correct regressiontests branch can still be master,\n\n#       because we do not fork it until behaviour needs to change.\n\n#   REGRESSIONTEST_MD5SUM\n\n#       The MD5 checksum of the regressiontest tarball. Only used when building\n\n#       from a source package.\n\n#   GMX_SOURCE_DOI_ID\n\n#       ID collected from Zenodo connected to the doi for a released version\n\n#       used to identify the source when building an official released version.\n\n#       This ID is used for the source code tarball.\n\n#   GMX_MANUAL_DOI_ID\n\n#       Same as above, but for the reference manual.\n\n# They are collected into a single section below.\n\n# The following variables are set based on these:\n\n#   GMX_VERSION            String composed from GMX_VERSION_* numeric variables\n\n#       above. Example: 4.6.1, 5.0, 2016\n\n#   GMX_VERSION_STRING     String with GMX_VERSION suffixed with the given\n\n#       suffix and possibly \"-dev\" for builds not from a source package.\n\n#   GMX_VERSION_NUMERIC    Numeric version number (e.g., 40601 for 4.6.1, 20160001 for 2016.1).\n\n#   GMX_API_VERSION        Numeric API version.\n\n#       This is currently set automatically to GMX_VERSION_NUMERIC, but may\n\n#       become manually maintained in the future if there will be releases\n\n#       where the API does not change, but programs/libraries do.\n\n#       In such a case, this should be the first version where the current API\n\n#       appeared.\n\n#   REGRESSIONTEST_VERSION For source packages, version number of the\n\n#       matching regressiontests tarball.  Not used for builds not from source\n\n#       packages.\n\n# The latter two are used to generate gromacs/version.h to allow software\n\n# written against the GROMACS API to provide some #ifdef'ed code to support\n\n# multiple GROMACS versions.\n\n#\n\n# This script also declares machinery to generate and obtain version\n\n# information from a git repository.  This is enabled by default if the source\n\n# tree is a git, but can be disabled with\n\n#   GMX_GIT_VERSION_INFO           Advanced CMake variable to disable git\n\n#                                  version info generation.\n\n# If the version generation is disabled, then the source and manual doi\n\n# will be based on the stored values for the ID.\n\n# The main interface to this machinery is the gmx_configure_version_file()\n\n# CMake function.  The signature is\n\n#   gmx_configure_version_file(<input> <output>\n\n#                              [REMOTE_HASH]\n\n#                              [TARGET <target>]\n\n#                              [COMMENT <comment>])\n\n#   <input>      Specify the input and output files as for configure_file().\n\n#   <output>     The configuration is done with configure_file(... @ONLY) with\n\n#                the following variables defined (as well as all the\n\n#                GMX_VERSION* variables from above):\n\n#                  GMX_VERSION_STRING_FULL\n\n#                  GMX_VERSION_FULL_HASH\n\n#                  GMX_VERSION_CENTRAL_BASE_HASH\n\n#                The output file is created during build time, so any dependent\n\n#                targets should specify it as a dependency.\n\n#   REMOTE_HASH  Currently, this has no effect, but it signifies that the\n\n#                <input> file is using the CENTRAL_BASE_HASH variable.\n\n#                This variable is much more expensive to initialize than the\n\n#                others, so this allows local changes in this file to only\n\n#                compute that value when required if that becomes necessary.\n\n#   TARGET       By default, this function uses add_custom_command() to\n\n#                generate the output file.

The latex output is placed\n\n#       in LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH or CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR if the former is\n\n#       not set.  The latex program is picky about where files are located,\n\n#       so all input files are copied from the source directory to the\n\n#       output directory.  This includes the target tex file, any tex file\n\n#       listed with the INPUTS option, the bibliography files listed with\n\n#       the BIBFILES option, and any .cls, .bst, and .clo files found in\n\n#       the current source directory.  Images found in the IMAGE_DIRS\n\n#       directories or listed by IMAGES are also copied to the output\n\n#       directory and coverted to an appropriate format if necessary.  Any\n\n#       tex files also listed with the CONFIGURE option are also processed\n\n#       with the CMake CONFIGURE_FILE command (with the @ONLY flag.  Any\n\n#       file listed in CONFIGURE but not the target tex file or listed with\n\n#       INPUTS has no effect. DEPENDS can be used to specify generated files\n\n#       that are needed to compile the latex target.\n\n#\n\n#       The following targets are made:\n\n#               dvi: Makes <name>.dvi\n\n#               pdf: Makes <name>.pdf using pdflatex.\n\n#               safepdf: Makes <name>.pdf using ps2pdf.  If using the default\n\n#                       program arguments, this will ensure all fonts are\n\n#                       embedded and no lossy compression has been performed\n\n#                       on images.\n\n#               ps: Makes <name>.ps\n\n#               html: Makes <name>.html\n\n#               auxclean: Deletes <name>.aux.  This is sometimes necessary\n\n#                       if a LaTeX error occurs and writes a bad aux file.\n\n#\n\n#       The dvi target is added to the ALL.  That is, it will be the target\n\n#       built by default.  If the DEFAULT_PDF argument is given, then the\n\n#       pdf target will be the default instead of dvi.  In GROMACS, we\n\n#       have hacked this - no target is ever added to ALL.\n\n#\n\n#       If the argument MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES is given, then each of the\n\n#       target names above will be mangled with the <tex_file> name.  This\n\n#       is to make the targets unique if ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT is called for\n\n#       multiple documents.  If the argument USE_INDEX is given, then\n\n#       commands to build an index are made.  If the argument USE_GLOSSARY\n\n#       is given, then commands to build a glossary are made.\n\n#\n\n# History:\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.4 Added the DEFAULT_SAFEPDF option (thanks to Raymond Wan).\n\n#\n\n#       Added warnings when image directories are not found (and were\n\n#       probably not given relative to the source directory).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.3 Fix some issues with interactions between makeglossaries and bibtex\n\n#       (thanks to Mark de Wever).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.2 Use ps2pdf to convert eps to pdf to get around the problem with\n\n#       ImageMagick dropping the bounding box (thanks to Lukasz Lis).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.1 Fixed some dependency issues.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.0 Added DEPENDS options (thanks to Theodore Papadopoulo).\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.1 Ported the makeglossaries command to CMake and embedded the port\n\n#       into UseLATEX.cmake.\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.0 Allow the use of the makeglossaries command.  Thanks to Oystein\n\n#       S. Haaland for the patch.\n\n#\n\n# 1.5.0 Allow any type of file in the INPUTS lists, not just tex file\n\n#       (suggested by Eric Noulard).  As a consequence, the ability to\n\n#       specify tex files without the .tex extension is removed.  The removed\n\n#       function is of dubious value anyway.\n\n#\n\n#       When copying input files, skip over any file that exists in the\n\n#       binary directory but does not exist in the source directory with the\n\n#       assumption that these files were added by some other mechanism.  I\n\n#       find this useful when creating large documents with multiple\n\n#       chapters that I want to build separately (for speed) as I work on\n\n#       them.  I use the same boilerplate as the starting point for all\n\n#       and just copy it with different configurations.  This was what the\n\n#       separate ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT method was supposed to originally be for.\n\n#       Since its external use is pretty much deprecated, I removed that\n\n#       documentation.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.1 Copy .sty files along with the other class and package files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.0 Added a MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES option that will mangle the target names.\n\n#\n\n#       Fixed problem with copying bib files that became apparent with\n\n#       CMake 2.4.\n\n#\n\n# 1.3.0 Added a LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH variable that allows you or the user to\n\n#       specify where the built latex documents to go.  This is especially\n\n#       handy if you want to do in-source builds.\n\n#\n\n#       Removed the ADD_LATEX_IMAGES macro and absorbed the functionality\n\n#       into ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT.  The old interface was always kind of\n\n#       clunky anyway since you had to specify the image directory in both\n\n#       places.  It also made supporting LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH problematic.\n\n#\n\n#       Added support for jpeg files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.2.0 Changed the configuration options yet again.  Removed the NO_CONFIGURE\n\n#       Replaced it with a CONFIGURE option that lists input files for which\n\n#       configure should be run.\n\n#\n\n#       The pdf target no longer depends on the dvi target.  This allows you\n\n#       to build latex documents that require pdflatex.  Also added an option\n\n#       to make the pdf target the default one.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.1 Added the NO_CONFIGURE option.  The @ character can be used when\n\n#       specifying table column separators.  If two or more are used, then\n\n#       will incorrectly substitute them.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.0 Added ability include multiple bib files.  Added ability to do copy\n\n#       sub-tex files for multipart tex files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.0.0 If both ps and pdf type images exist, just copy the one that\n\n#       matches the current render mode.  Replaced a bunch of STRING\n\n#       commands with GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT commands that were made to do\n\n#       the desired function.\n\n#\n\n# 0.4.0 First version posted to CMake Wiki.\n\n#\n",
