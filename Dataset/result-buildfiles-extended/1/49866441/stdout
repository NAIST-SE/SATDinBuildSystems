Copy this file into your cmake modules path.\n\n#\n\n# 2. Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:\n\n#      include(CodeCoverage)\n\n#\n\n# 3. Append necessary compiler flags:\n\n#      APPEND_COVERAGE_COMPILER_FLAGS()\n\n#\n\n# 4. If you need to exclude additional directories from the report, specify them\n\n#    using the COVERAGE_LCOV_EXCLUDES variable before calling SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE_LCOV.\n\n#    Example:\n\n#      set(COVERAGE_LCOV_EXCLUDES 'dir1/*' 'dir2/*')\n\n#\n\n# 5. Use the functions described below to create a custom make target which\n\n#    runs your test executable and produces a code coverage report.\n\n#\n\n# 6. Build a Debug build:\n\n#      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\n\n#      make\n\n#      make my_coverage_target\n\n#\n",
