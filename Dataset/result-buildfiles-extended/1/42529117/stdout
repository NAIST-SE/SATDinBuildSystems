These values are used to generate the final SDL2_LIBRARY\n\n# variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARY does not get created.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would\n\n# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR\n\n# used in building SDL2.\n\n# l.e.galup  9-20-02\n\n#\n\n# Modified by Eric Wing.\n\n# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables\n\n# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.\n\n# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and\n\n# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).\n\n# Also corrected the header search path to follow \"proper\" SDL2 guidelines.\n\n# Added a search for SDL2main which is needed by some platforms.\n\n# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.\n\n# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.\n\n#\n\n# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.\n\n# People will have to manually change the cache values of\n\n# SDL2_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment\n\n# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.\n\n#\n\n# Note that the header path has changed from SDL2/SDL.h to just SDL.h\n\n# This needed to change because \"proper\" SDL2 convention\n\n# is #include \"SDL.h\", not <SDL2/SDL.h>. This is done for portability\n\n# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL2/ (see FreeBSD).\n\n#\n\n# Ported by Johnny Patterson. This is a literal port for SDL2 of the FindSDL.cmake\n\n# module with the minor edit of changing \"SDL\" to \"SDL2\" where necessary. This\n\n# was not created for redistribution, and exists temporarily pending official\n\n# SDL2 CMake modules.\n",
