If\n      the directory does not match the enhanced class' package, the package\n      structure will be created beneath the directory. By default, the\n      enhancer overwrites the original .class file.\n    * -enforcePropertyRestrictions/-epr <true/t | false/f>: Whether to\n      throw an exception when it appears that a property access entity is\n      not obeying the restrictions placed on property access. Defaults to\n      false.\n    * -addDefaultConstructor/-adc <true/t | false/f>: The spec requires\n      that all persistent classes define a no-arg constructor. This flag\n      tells the enhancer whether to add a protected no-arg constructor to\n      any persistent classes that don't already have one. Defaults to true.\n    * -tmpClassLoader/-tcl <true/t | false/f>: Whether to load persistent\n      classes with a temporary class loader. This allows other code to then\n      load the enhanced version of the class within the same JVM. Defaults\n      to true. Try setting this flag to false as a debugging step if you\n      run into class loading problems when running the enhancer.\n\nEach additional argument to the enhancer must be one of the following:\n    * The full name of a class.\n    * The .java file for a class.\n    * The .class file of a class.\n\nIf you do not supply any arguments to the enhancer, it will run on the -\n     - classes in your persistent class list (see Section 1, “Persistent\n     Class List”).\n\nYou can run the enhancer over classes that have already been enhanced, in -\n     - which case it will not further modify the class. You can also run\n     it over classes that are not persistence-capable, in which case it\n     will treat the class as persistence-aware. Persistence-aware classes\n     can directly manipulate the persistent fields of persistence-capable\n     classes.\n\nNote that the enhancement process for subclasses introduces dependencies on -\n     - the persistent parent class being enhanced. This is normally not\n     problematic; however, when running the enhancer multiple times over a\n     subclass whose parent class is not yet enhanced, class loading errors\n     can occur. In the event of a class load error, simply re-compile and\n     re-enhance the offending classes.\n",

Again, for a list of available \n    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the\n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n    ",

Inside each component directory there is a normal bin, lib, share, ... hierarchy for \r\n\n# that component. But when creating the wxs-xml description all the subdirs \r\n\n# found in the various component directories must merged into one tree. Describing this merged virtual \r\n\n# tree in xml is difficult, e.g. when encountering the share directory for the first component an \r\n\n# xml tag for this directory is created. But before the end-tag can be insterted all of the \r\n\n# subdirectories of share must be added. But other components may add other directories under share, \r\n\n# so no end tags can be inserted until the entire installation has been traversed. In create_msi.cmake\r\n\n# this was handled by creating the merged directory tree with empty directories while traversing the \r\n\n# component-based installation, and then create the wxs-xml for the directories from this tree of \r\n\n# empty directories. Since _create_msi.cmake also leaves behind this directory tree it can be used to \r\n\n# simplify the logic of the WIX_DESCRIBE_DIRS function.\r\n\n# Args:\r\n\n#   dir - directory to describe the members of\r\n\n#   prefix - indentation space\r\n\n# Globals:\r\n\n#   DIR_LIST - list of relative directories encountered.

The latter is a wix component group).\r\n\n# \r\n\n# This is essentially a re-implementation of the same functionality in create_msi.cmake, \r\n\n# but with one crucial difference: Where create_msi.cmake tries to create a 1-to-1 mapping between the \r\n\n# (relative) file/directory name and its wxs-xml id, this function uses numeric ids. Trying to convert \r\n\n# filenames into ids causes a number of problems:\r\n\n# 1) Not all characters that are legal in filenames are legal in wxs-xml identifiers\r\n\n# 2) The old solution of mapping all illegal characters to '_' can (and does for some files in \r\n\n#    the Python installation) yield non-unique ids. This is illegal.\r\n\n# 3) wxs-xml ids can only be 72 characters long. The old solution of \r\n\n#    truncating is error-prone as fewer characters are permitted as the first character of an id. \r\n\n#    (create_msi.cmake also has bugs where a truncated id is combined with additional character to \r\n\n#    produce an id that is still longer than 72 characters. \r\n\n# Using numeric ids elliminates these problems but the fact that the id cannot be obtained from the \r\n\n# file/directory name creates additional challenges. E.g. the id of a file's parent directory could previously be \r\n\n# obtained from the directory portion of the filename. Now this id is not known until the wxs-xml \r\n\n# for the directories have been created, and even then the ids are buried in the generated xml. \r\n\n# The solution is to store the directorry name (relative to the component directory) in a list, \r\n\n# and use the directory's index in this list as the id. The directories must be traversed first \r\n\n# to populate the list.\r\n",
