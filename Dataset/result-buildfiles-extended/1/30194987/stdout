In other words, the library implements all the\n\n##      interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT - AGE' to\n\n##      `CURRENT'.\n\n##\n\n##    If two libraries have identical CURRENT and AGE numbers, then the\n\n## dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater REVISION number.\n\n##\n\n##   1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.\n\n##\n\n##   2. Update the version information only immediately before a public\n\n##      release of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary,\n\n##      and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger\n\n##      faster.\n\n##\n\n##   3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last\n\n##      update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').\n\n##\n\n##   4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the\n\n##      last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.\n\n##\n\n##   5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,\n\n##      then increment AGE.\n\n##\n\n##   6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,\n\n##      then set AGE to 0.\n",
