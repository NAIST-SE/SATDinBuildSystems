Unless there is only one argument in the function and it is clear.\n\n#\n\n# * Never use macros. They allow overwriting global variables and this\n\n#\tmakes variable declarations hard to locate.\n\n#\n\n# * If a target from add_custom_* is set in a function, explicitly pass it\n\n#\tas an output argument so that the target name is clear to the user.\n\n#\n\n# * Avoid use of global variables in functions. Functions in a nested\n\n#\tscope may use global variables, but this makes it difficult to\n\n#\treuse functions.\n\n#\n\n# Included CMake Files\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#\n\n# * All variables in config files must have the prefix \"config_\".\n\n#\n\n# * Never set global variables in an included cmake file,\n\n#\tyou may only define functions. This excludes config and Toolchain files.\n\n#\tThis makes it clear to the user when variables are being set or targets\n\n#\tare being created.\n\n#\n\n# * Setting a global variable in a CMakeLists.txt file is ok, because\n\n#\teach CMakeLists.txt file has scope in the current directory and all\n\n#\tsubdirectories, so it is not truly global.\n\n#\n\n# * All toolchain files should be included in the cmake\n\n#\tdirectory and named Toolchain-\"name\".cmake.\n\n#\n\n# Misc\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#\n\n# * If referencing a string variable, don't put it in quotes.\n\n#\tDon't do \"${PX4_PLATFORM}\" STREQUAL \"posix\",\n\n#\tinstead type ${PX4_PLATFORM} STREQUAL \"posix\".
