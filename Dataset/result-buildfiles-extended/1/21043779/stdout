This makes it simple to verify that your\n\n# test environment is sane: if all of the images are the same version, they\n\n# should work together.\n\n#\n\n# As part of the process of releasing those images, we tag all of the images\n\n# with the version number of the release. This means that anything that uses\n\n# the images can reference them as `teradatalabs/image_name:version'. The\n\n# Makefile needs to know that to pull the images, and the python code needs to\n\n# know that for various reasons.\n\n#\n\n# base-images-tag.json is the canonical source of the tag information for the\n\n# repository. The python code parses it properly with the json module, and the\n\n# Makefile parses it adequately with awk ;-)\n\n#\n",
