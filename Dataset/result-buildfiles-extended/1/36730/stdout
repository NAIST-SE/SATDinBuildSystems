Default to 7200000 (2 hours).\n\n    To run a specific package of tests, use the \"jpatck.pkg.dir\" system\n    property to specify the parent directory of the tests you want to run.\n    E.g.:\n\n        mvn integration-test -Ptck2-profile -Djpatck.pkg.dir=com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/persistence/inheritance/mappedsc/descriptors\n\n    You can also run using another database (e.g., oracle) using command\n    line properties. For example:\n\n        mvn integration-test -Ddb.name=oracle -Ddb.driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver -Ddb.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@dbhost:1526:dbname -Ddb.username=scott -Ddb.password=tiger -Ddb.jar=/tmp/oracle-jdbc.jar -Dtest=false -Ptck-profile -Djpatck.pkg.dir=com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/persistence/query/apitests -Djpatck.test=queryAPITest15\n\n    The TCK running process will do the following:\n\n    1. Find the TCK zip file and extract it\n    2. Create an openjpa-provier.properties file with the OpenJPA config\n    3. Modify the TCK's main configuration file (ts.jte) to use OpenJPA\n    4. Run the database initialization script\n    5. Run the TCK script\n    6. Parse the TCK result log to determine whether to fail the build or not\n",
