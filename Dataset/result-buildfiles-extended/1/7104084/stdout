It helps making the resulting package\n\n# relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in the installed Config.cmake file.\n\n#\n\n# In a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to make the\n\n# install destinations know to the using project:\n\n#   set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   \"@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@\" )\n\n#   set(FOO_DATA_DIR   \"@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@\" )\n\n#   set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   \"@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons\" )\n\n#   ...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...\n\n#   set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  \"${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@\" )\n\n# All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode\n\n# the absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic\n\n# to determine the installedPrefix is correct, and if CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR contains\n\n# a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed.\n\n# This has the effect that the resulting FooConfig.cmake file would work poorly\n\n# under Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location\n\n# of a binary package at install time, independent from how CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\n\n# was set at build/cmake time.\n\n#\n\n# Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used correctly, it makes the\n\n# resulting FooConfig.cmake file relocatable.\n\n# Usage:\n\n#   1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to\n\n#   2. insert a line containing only the string \"@PACKAGE_INIT@\"\n\n#   3. instead of SET(FOO_DIR \"@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@\"), use SET(FOO_DIR \"@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@\")\n\n#      (this must be after the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line)\n\n#   4. instead of using the normal CONFIGURE_FILE(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()\n\n#\n\n# The <input> and <output> arguments are the input and output file, the same way\n\n# as in CONFIGURE_FILE().\n\n#\n\n# The <path> given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must be the destination where the FooConfig.cmake\n\n# file will be installed to. This can either be a relative or absolute path, both work.\n\n#\n\n# The variables <var1> to <varN> given as PATH_VARS are the variables which contain\n\n# install destinations. For each of them the macro will create a helper variable\n\n# PACKAGE_<var...>. These helper variables must be used\n\n# in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for setting the installed location. They are calculated\n\n# by CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() so that they are always relative to the\n\n# installed location of the package. This works both for relative and also for absolute locations.\n\n# For absolute locations it works only if the absolute location is a subdirectory\n\n# of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.\n\n#\n\n# By default configure_package_config_file() also generates two helper macros,\n\n# set_and_check() and check_required_components() into the FooConfig.cmake file.\n\n#\n\n# set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal set()\n\n# command for setting directories and file locations. Additionally to setting the\n\n# variable it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists\n\n# and fails with a FATAL_ERROR otherwise. This makes sure that the created\n\n# FooConfig.cmake file does not contain wrong references.\n\n# When using the NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO, this macro is not generated into the\n\n# FooConfig.cmake file.\n\n#\n\n# check_required_components(<package_name>) should be called at the end of the\n\n# FooConfig.cmake file if the package supports components.\n\n# This macro checks whether all requested, non-optional components have been found,\n\n# and if this is not the case, sets the Foo_FOUND variable to FALSE, so that the package\n\n# is considered to be not found.\n\n# It does that by testing the Foo_<Component>_FOUND variables for all requested\n\n# required components.\n\n# When using the NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is not generated\n\n# into the FooConfig.cmake file.\n\n#\n\n# For an example see below the documentation for WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE().\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#  WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )\n\n#\n\n# Writes a file for use as <package>ConfigVersion.cmake file to <filename>.\n\n# See the documentation of FIND_PACKAGE() for details on this.\n\n#    filename is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.\n\n#    major.minor.patch is the version number of the project to be installed\n\n# The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means that the installed package version\n\n# will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version.\n\n# This mode should be used for packages which are fully backward compatible,\n\n# also across major versions.\n\n# If SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the behaviour differs from AnyNewerVersion\n\n# in that the major version number must be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will\n\n# not be considered compatible if 1.0 is requested.\n\n# This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward compatibility within the\n\n# same major version.\n\n# If ExactVersion is used, then the package is only considered compatible if the requested\n\n# version matches exactly its own version number (not considering the tweak version).\n\n# For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3.\n\n# This mode is for packages without compatibility guarantees.\n\n# If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to write your\n\n# own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using this macro.\n\n#\n\n# Internally, this macro executes configure_file() to create the resulting\n\n# version file. Depending on the COMPATIBILITY, either the file\n\n# BasicConfigVersion-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in or BasicConfigVersion-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in\n\n# is used. Please note that these two files are internal to CMake and you should\n\n# not call configure_file() on them yourself, but they can be used as starting\n\n# point to create more sophisticted custom ConfigVersion.cmake files.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n# Example using both configure_package_config_file() and write_basic_package_version_file():\n\n# CMakeLists.txt:\n\n#   set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )\n\n#   set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )\n\n#   set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ...
