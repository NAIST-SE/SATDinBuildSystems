These extra_defs are NOT honored\n\n#   for Makefile generators and should be added by the caller to the\n\n#   target or global flags.\n\n# + Have assembly files #include a configure.h or other header to obtain\n\n#   their defines (this file does not support passing them in via cmdline\n\n#   to the preprocessor or the assembler).\n\n# + For pure assembly files, use add_asm_target(); for split C/C++ + asm files,\n\n#   separate the two pieces via #ifdef ASM_CODE_ONLY and use\n\n#   add_split_asm_target().\n\n# + For VS generators, add the returned target as a dependence of the final\n\n#   executable/library target to avoid races when building.\n\n#\n\n# Example:\n\n#\n\n#   set(asm_deps \"/path/to/cpp2asm_defines.h\" \"/path/to/configure.h\")\n\n#   set(asm_defs -I \"/path/to/cpp2asm_defines.h\" -I \"/path/to/configure.h\")\n\n#   add_asm_target(foo.asm foo_asm_src foo_asm_tgt \"\" \"${asm_defs}\" ${asm_deps})\n\n#   add_library(bar bar.c ${foo_asm_src})\n\n#   if (\"${CMAKE_GENERATOR}\" MATCHES \"Visual Studio\")\n\n#     add_dependencies(bar ${foo_asm_tgt})\n\n#   endif (\"${CMAKE_GENERATOR}\" MATCHES \"Visual Studio\")\n\n#\n\n###########################################################################\n",
