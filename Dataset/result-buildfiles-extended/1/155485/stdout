To run the tests\n        in your IDE, the project has to be built to the \"package\" phase with\n        the profile \"ide\" enabled:\n        \n             $ mvn -Pide clean package\n             \n        This creates the configadmin.jar file in the target folder, which is used by\n        the integration tests when run from the IDE. Alternatively the\n        \"project.bundle.file\" system property may be set to the bundle JAR\n        in the IDE launcher. \n    ",

To run the tests\n        in your IDE, the project has to be built to the \"package\" phase with\n        the profile \"ide\" enabled:\n        \n             $ mvn -Pide clean package\n             \n        This creates the scr.jar file in the target folder, which is used by\n        the integration tests when run from the IDE. Alternatively the\n        \"project.bundle.file\" system property may be set to the bundle JAR\n        in the IDE launcher. \n    ",
