The\n\n# semi-supported hack using __requires__ in the $SPHINXBUILD definition\n\n# is a workaround: http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue139\n\n# (Fedora/EPEL has python-cherrypy2 = 2.3 and python-cherrypy = 3)\n\n# (EPEL6 has python-sphinx = 0.6 and python-sphinx10 = 1.0)\n\n#\n\n# In addition, if the pkg_resources dependency chain includes anything which\n\n# needs to be added to sys.path *and* anything which is in site-packages, then\n\n# site-packages gets prepended to sys.path in front of anything we pass in\n\n# through PYTHONPATH. That means, if you have bkr in site-packages it will be\n\n# imported instead of the local source. To work around the pkg_resources\n\n# behaviour we have to fiddle with bkr.__path__ ourselves in addition to\n\n# setting PYTHONPATH.\n\n#\n\n# Also see: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/6/\n",
