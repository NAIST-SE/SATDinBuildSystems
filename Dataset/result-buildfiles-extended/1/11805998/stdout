(But when this happens,\n      META-INF/** in the outer jar will be ignored.)\n\n      For a fragment to be added to the distribution, the distribution POM needs\n      to directly or indirectly depend on the fragment module. This is normally\n      done by creating a feature-level grouping POM (which allows you to bundle multiple\n      modules and treat it as a single dependency - see the webtier-all module for example),\n      and have that declare a dependency on the fragment, instead of directly\n      modifying the distribution POM.\n\n      So the idea here is that individual technology area will create their own\n      fragments that contain pieces that they need, and when the said technology\n      is bundled in GF, the corresponding fragment will be also added, thanks to\n      the transitive dependency handling in Maven.\n    ",

(But when this happens,\n      META-INF/** in the outer jar will be ignored.)\n\n      For a fragment to be added to the distribution, the distribution POM needs\n      to directly or indirectly depend on the fragment module.

(But when this happens,\n      META-INF/** in the jar will be ignored.)\n\n      For a fragment to be added to the distribution, the distribution POM needs\n      to directly or indirectly depend on the fragment module. This is normally\n      done by creating a feature-level grouping POM (which allows you to bundle multiple\n      modules and treat it as a single dependency - see the webtier-all module for example),\n      and have that declare a dependency on the fragment, instead of directly\n      modifying the distribution POM.\n\n      So the idea here is that individual technology area will create their own\n      fragments that contain pieces that they need, and when the said technology\n      is bundled in GF, the corresponding fragment will be also added, thanks to\n      the transitive dependency handling in Maven.\n    ",
