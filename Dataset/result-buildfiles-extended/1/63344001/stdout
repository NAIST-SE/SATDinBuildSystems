The\n            javax.persistence 2.1.1 JAR below isn’t signed so it doesn’t have the problem. See\n            https://stackoverflow.com/q/45870753 for more information.\n\n            Note that the below is JPA 2.1.1 whereas EclipseLink 2.7.x supports JPA 2.2. However,\n            https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.eclipselink/releases/2.7.3/review says\n            EclipseLink 2.7.3 still supports pre-2.2 versions of JPA (though deprecated). We\n            survived with JPA 2.1.1 when we were using EclipseLink 2.6.4 because that’s all it\n            supported. (We’ve never used JPA 2.2: the upgrade from EclipseLink 2.6.4 to 2.7.3\n            introduced the signing problem and is when we added the extra dependency below as a\n            mitigation).\n\n            If https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=525457 is anything to go by, a future\n            EclipseLink release should resolve this problem and we should be able to remove the\n            below dependency.\n        ",
