In this case, all the make\n\n# variables are added to the environment for each line of the recipes, so that\n\n# any sub-makefile can use them.\n\n# We have observed this can cause issues such as 'Argument list too long'\n\n# errors as the shell runs out of memory.\n\n# Since this Makefile won't call any sub-makefiles, and since the commands do\n\n# not expect to implicitely obtain any make variable from the environment, we\n\n# can safely cancel this export mechanism. Unfortunately, it can't be done\n\n# globally, only by name. Let's unexport MAKEFILE_LIST which is by far the\n\n# biggest one due to our way of tracking dependencies and compile flags\n\n# (we include many *.cmd and *.d files).\n",
