We will use this shared object solely to\n\n# link libc.so against it; that gives libc.so the proper DT_NEEDED record,\n\n# and symbol versions assignments (if the lib*user.so object is using them).\n\n# Finally we link a second version of the same lib*user.so shared object,\n\n# this time linked normally against libc so it gets a proper DT_NEEDED\n\n# record and symbol version set; this one can be installed for run-time use.\n",
