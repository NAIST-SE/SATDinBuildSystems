Basically the complete \n        project is build using Java 1.3 source and target compatibility (as inherited \n        from the parent pom). The exception are the unit tests in the \"integration\" \n        packages. These have to be compiled with Java 5 source and target compatibility \n        because the employ annotations and generics. For running the integration \n        tests from the console using Maven nothing special has to be done as the \n        tests run automatically. To run the tests in your IDE, the project has to \n        be built to the \"package\" phase with the profile \"ide\" enabled: $ mvn -Pide \n        clean package This creates the scr.jar file in the target folder, which is \n        used by the integration tests when run from the IDE. Alternatively the \"project.bundle.file\" \n        system property may be set to the bundle JAR in the IDE launcher. ",
