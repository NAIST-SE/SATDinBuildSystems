So. If you\n        need to introduce a new configuration property that needs to be overridable\n        by Bamboo/CI, make sure to set the property in one of the below config files,\n        so that it can be pre-emptively replaced by Maven prior to kicking off the\n        test run.

Here are\n          a few common situations this plugin helps with:\n\n          1) multiple implementations of a dependency - you only want to use one implementation\n          (ex: commons-logging vs jcl-over-slf4j, javax.mail vs geronimo-javamail_1.4_spec)\n          2) similar maven artifacts are produced for the same project - you only need to include one\n          (ex: cglib vs cglib-nodep)\n          3) an artifact's group id or artifact id has been renamed - maven considers these different\n          artifacts and you only want to include one\n          (ex: opensymphony:quartz vs org.opensymphony.quartz:quartz vs org.quartz-scheduler:quartz)\n          4) an artifact was added to the container and no longer is needed\n          (ex: jaxb in java 6)\n\n          This plugin also helps enforce consistent a consistent Java & Maven version are used. This helps the\n          stability of builds across systems.\n\n          This plugin also enforces that plugins specify a version number. Using meta version tags or not specifing a version\n          on a plugin is a decrecated feature as it leads to build instability.\n\n          Finally, the DependencyConvergence rule helps ensure that all of our submodules are resolving the same versions\n          of\n          artifacts by making sure that all deps converge.
