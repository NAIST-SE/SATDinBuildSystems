A replacementProperty can have a `property` and a `regex`-\n.\n                        If the replacementProperty configuration has a `property`-tag the replacement will only be performed on that specific property (e.g. `<property>git.branch</property>` will only be performed on `git.branch`).\n                        In case this specific element is not defined or left empty the replacement will be performed *on all generated properties*.\n                        The optional `regex`-Tag can either be true to perform a replacement with regular expressions or false to perform a replacement with java's string.replace-function. by default the replacement will be performed with regular expressions.\n                        Furthermore each replacementProperty need to be configured with a token and a value.\n                        The token can be seen as the needle and the value as the text to be written over any found tokens. If using regular expressions the value can reference grouped regex matches by using $1, $2, etc.\n\n                        Since 2.2.4 the plugin allows to define a even more sophisticated ruleset and allows to set an `propertyOutputSuffix` within each replacement property. If this option is empty the original property will be overwritten (default behaviour in 2.2.3). however when this configuration is set to `something` and a user wants to modify the `git.branch` property the plugin will keep `git.branch` as the original one (w/o modifications) but also will be creating a new `git.branch.something` property with the requested replacement.\n                        Furthermore with 2.2.4 the plugin allows to perform certain types of string manipulation either before or after the evaluation of the replacement. With this feature a user can currently easily manipulate the case (e.g. lower case VS upper case) of the input/output property. This behaviour can be achieved by defining a list of `transformationRules` for the property where those rules should take effect. Each `transformationRule` consist of two required fields `apply` and `action`. The `apply`-tag controls when the rule should be applied and can be set to `BEFORE` to have the rule being applied before or it can be set to `AFTER` to have the rule being applied after the replacement. The `action`-tag determines the string conversion rule that should be applied. Currently supported is `LOWER_CASE` and `UPPER_CASE`. Potential candidates in the feature are `CAPITALIZATION` and `INVERT_CASE``(open a ticket if you need them...).\n\n                        Please note that the replacement will *only be applied to properties that are being generated by the plugin*.\n                        If you want to replace properties that are being generated by other plugins you may want to use the maven-replacer-plugin or any other alternative.\n                    ",
