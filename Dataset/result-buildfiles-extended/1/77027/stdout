I have added that key to the list of search paths,\n\n# however, the key looks like it could be a little fragile depending on\n\n# if they decide to change the 1.00.0000 number for bug fix releases.\n\n# Also, they seem to have laid down groundwork for multiple library platforms\n\n# which puts the library in an extra subdirectory. Currently there is only\n\n# Win32 and I have hardcoded that here. This may need to be adjusted as\n\n# platforms are introduced.\n\n# The OpenAL 1.0 installer doesn't seem to have a useful key I can use.\n\n# I do not know if the Nvidia OpenAL SDK has a registry key.\n\n#\n\n# For OS X, remember that OpenAL was added by Apple in 10.4 (Tiger).\n\n# To support the framework, I originally wrote special framework detection\n\n# code in this module which I have now removed with CMake's introduction\n\n# of native support for frameworks.\n\n# In addition, OpenAL is open source, and it is possible to compile on Panther.\n\n# Furthermore, due to bugs in the initial OpenAL release, and the\n\n# transition to OpenAL 1.1, it is common to need to override the built-in\n\n# framework.\n\n# Per my request, CMake should search for frameworks first in\n\n# the following order:\n\n# ~/Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework/Headers\n\n# /Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework/Headers\n\n# /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework/Headers\n\n#\n\n# On OS X, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.\n\n# People will have to manually change the cache values of\n\n# OPENAL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment\n\n# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.\n",
