Eg. org.slf4j.Logger interface in slf4j-api\n                        becomes org.slf4j.shaded.Logger and none of the Logger implementations\n                        provided by storm would implement org.slf4j.shaded.Logger. This in turn\n                        would lead slf4j-api to bind to NOPLogger resulting in loss of application\n                        logs.\n                     b) Classes from org.slf4j are referenced within slf4j bridge artifacts like\n                        'log4j-over-slf4j'.
