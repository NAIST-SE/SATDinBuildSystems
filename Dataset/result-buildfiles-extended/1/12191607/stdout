        "Text" : "\n\n    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be \n    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed \n    before and after some main targets. Those of them relevant for JavaFX project are: \n\n      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties\n      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties\n      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation\n      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation\n      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -pre-jfx-jar:              called before FX SDK specific <fx:jar> task\n      -post-jfx-jar:             called after FX SDK specific <fx:jar> task\n      -pre-jfx-deploy:           called before FX SDK specific <fx:deploy> task\n      -post-jfx-deploy:          called after FX SDK specific <fx:deploy> task\n      -pre-jfx-native:           called just after -pre-jfx-deploy if <fx:deploy> runs in native packaging mode\n      -post-jfx-native:          called just after -post-jfx-deploy if <fx:deploy> runs in native packaging mode\n      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products\n\n    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)\n\n    Example of inserting a HTML postprocessor after javaFX SDK deployment:\n\n        <target name=\"-post-jfx-deploy\">\n            <basename property=\"jfx.deployment.base\" file=\"${jfx.deployment.jar}\" suffix=\".jar\"/>\n            <property name=\"jfx.deployment.html\" location=\"${jfx.deployment.dir}${file.separator}${jfx.deployment.base}.html\"/>\n            <custompostprocess>\n                <fileset dir=\"${jfx.deployment.html}\"/>\n            </custompostprocess>\n        </target>\n\n    Example of calling an Ant task from JavaFX SDK. Note that access to JavaFX SDK Ant tasks must be\n    initialized; to ensure this is done add the dependence on -check-jfx-sdk-version target:\n\n        <target name=\"-post-jfx-jar\" depends=\"-check-jfx-sdk-version\">\n            <echo message=\"Calling jar task from JavaFX SDK\"/>\n            <fx:jar ...>\n                ...\n            </fx:jar>\n        </target>\n\n    For more details about JavaFX SDK Ant tasks go to\n    http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/deployment/jfxpub-deployment.htm\n\n    For list of available properties check the files\n    nbproject/build-impl.xml and nbproject/jfx-impl.xml.\n\n    ",
