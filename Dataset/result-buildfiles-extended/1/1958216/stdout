These\n       are the non-OSGi bundles we want to package, e.g. Jena \n       and any dependencies that are not easily available as\n       bundles..\n\n       Those without <scope> (e.g. compile) below are already\n       OSGi bundles and will become runtime dependencies of\n       the jena-osgi bundle when used through Maven. Their\n       transitive dependencies (e.g. jsonld-java depends on \n       jackson-core) are not explicitly listed here.\n\n       Note that many OSGi users don't use Maven\n       and would have to find those dependencies\n       themselves. See ../jena-osgi-test/ for\n       example.\n\n\n       To avoid duplicates of non-bundle and bundle dependencies,\n       e.g. httpcore vs. httpcore-osgi, there are several\n       <excludes> below - as not everyone \n       follows the <scope>provided</scope> pattern.\n\n       Use mvn dependency:tree to inspect what dependencies are\n       exposed in the end, and unzip -t target/*.jar to inspect\n       what becomes bundled in the bundle.\n\n       Explore META-INF/MANFEST.MF in the jar to see what\n       Import and Export the maven-bundle-plugin has figured out,\n       usually the details figured out through code \n       introspections are correct - if verbose.\n\n       ",
