SJC also provides plugins of various sorts, such\n\t\t\tas the core Service plugin implementations.\n\n\t\t\tIn order for these to be processed correctly and avoid a\n\t\t\tchicken-and-egg problem with annotation processing here, we\n\t\t\tdisable annotation processing during compilation, and instead\n\t\t\trun the plugin indexer manually in the process-classes phase.\n\t\t\t",
