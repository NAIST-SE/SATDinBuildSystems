These targets are usually executed \n    before and after some main targets. They are: \n\n      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties \n      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties \n      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation \n      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation \n      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file\n      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file\n      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test\n      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test\n      -pre-dist:                 called before archive building \n      -post-dist:                called after archive building \n      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products \n      -pre-run-deploy:           called before deploying\n      -post-run-deploy:          called after deploying\n\n    Example of pluging an obfuscator after the compilation could look like \n\n        <target name=\"-post-compile\">\n            <obfuscate>\n                <fileset dir=\"${build.classes.dir}\"/>\n            </obfuscate>\n        </target>\n\n    For list of available properties check the imported \n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n\n    Other way how to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.\n    The target of interest are: \n\n      init-macrodef-javac:    defines macro for javac compilation\n      init-macrodef-junit:   defines macro for junit execution\n      init-macrodef-debug:    defines macro for class debugging\n      do-dist:                archive building\n      run:                    execution of project \n      javadoc-build:          javadoc generation \n\n    Example of overriding the target for project execution could look like \n\n        <target name=\"run\" depends=\"<PROJNAME>-impl.jar\">\n            <exec dir=\"bin\" executable=\"launcher.exe\">\n                <arg file=\"${dist.jar}\"/>\n            </exec>\n        </target>\n\n    Notice that overridden target depends on jar target and not only on \n    compile target as regular run target does. Again, for list of available \n    properties which you can use check the target you are overriding in \n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n    ",
