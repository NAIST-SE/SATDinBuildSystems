It is here for convenience by request, by people who probably work with outdated IDE versions or company policies.\n\n  Use Gradle to build archie in all other cases, the Gradle build file allows for repository upload, has cleaner more readable code, guarantees the same tool build versions, has jacoco-integration and builds faster than the Maven version. It also works without any extra tools other than JDK8 due to the gradle wrapper.\n\n  This file is created by taking the automatically generated pom from Gradle, with the lines from the file called 'pom_snippet' added.  \n  ",
