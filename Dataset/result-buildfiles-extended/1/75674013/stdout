This is done for portability\n\n# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL2/ (see FreeBSD).\n\n#\n\n# Ported by Johnny Patterson. This is a literal port for SDL2 of the FindSDL.cmake\n\n# module with the minor edit of changing \"SDL\" to \"SDL2\" where necessary. This\n\n# was not created for redistribution, and exists temporarily pending official\n\n# SDL2 CMake modules.\n",
