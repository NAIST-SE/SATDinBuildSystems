This replaces\n\n#   the old POTFILES.in since the list of files you want to select for\n\n#   translation is invariably all of them.\n\n#\n\n# - If you have other files that can't be selected by suffix, or that need to\n\n#   be built from source files, add them to POTFILE_EXTRA\n\n#\n\n# - Add po/Makefile to AC_CONFIG_FILES (there may be po/Makefile.in if\n\n#   switching from gettextize, replace that)\n\n#\n\n# - Get rid of AM_GNU_GETTEXT and AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION. You might want to\n\n#   add checks for xgettext, msgmerge, msgfmt, and msgcat. Up to you.\n\n#\n\n# - Add the following to .gitignore:\n\n#     po/*.mo\n\n#     po/*.po\n\n#     po/*.mpo\n\n#     po/*.pot\n\n#\n\n# - Remove everything in the po/ directory from source control except this\n\n#   file.\n\n#\n\n# The idea is something like this:\n\n#   From a clean project, you do the automake stuff and download a bunch of\n\n#   .po files from the external translation site. These are the \"source\" files.\n\n#\n\n#   From the source tree we create a template file, <package>.pot, of all the\n\n#   translatable strings. This file is not saved or distributed because there's\n\n#   really no reason to do that if translations are not part of the source\n\n#   tree. The file is pushed to the translators when creating a new release,\n\n#   and it is used during the build, and that's it.\n\n#\n\n#   The .po files might not match the .pot file, because this is the nature of\n\n#   linear time and translations being a separate task. Maybe the translator\n\n#   last touched the .po file yesterday. Maybe three years ago. To get the\n\n#   translations in sync with the source, which usually means untranslating\n\n#   some strings, we run msgmerge on all of the source files. The merged files\n\n#   are saved in builddir as <lang>.mpo, which is a non-standard file extension\n\n#   I just made up.\n\n#\n\n#   The merged .po files are then compiled into .mo files, which are what\n\n#   get installed to /usr/share/locale.\n",
