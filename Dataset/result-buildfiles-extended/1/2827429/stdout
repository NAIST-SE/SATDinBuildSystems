The latex output is placed\n\n#       in LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH or CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR if the former is\n\n#       not set.  The latex program is picky about where files are located,\n\n#       so all input files are copied from the source directory to the\n\n#       output directory.  This includes the target tex file, any tex file\n\n#       listed with the INPUTS option, the bibliography files listed with\n\n#       the BIBFILES option, and any .cls, .bst, and .clo files found in\n\n#       the current source directory.  Images found in the IMAGE_DIRS\n\n#       directories or listed by IMAGES are also copied to the output\n\n#       directory and coverted to an appropriate format if necessary.  Any\n\n#       tex files also listed with the CONFIGURE option are also processed\n\n#       with the CMake CONFIGURE_FILE command (with the @ONLY flag).  Any\n\n#       file listed in CONFIGURE but not the target tex file or listed with\n\n#       INPUTS has no effect. DEPENDS can be used to specify generated files\n\n#       that are needed to compile the latex target.\n\n#\n\n#       The following targets are made:\n\n#               dvi: Makes <name>.dvi\n\n#               pdf: Makes <name>.pdf using pdflatex.\n\n#               safepdf: Makes <name>.pdf using ps2pdf.  If using the default\n\n#                       program arguments, this will ensure all fonts are\n\n#                       embedded and no lossy compression has been performed\n\n#                       on images.\n\n#               ps: Makes <name>.ps\n\n#               html: Makes <name>.html\n\n#               auxclean: Deletes <name>.aux and other auxiliary files.\n\n#                       This is sometimes necessary if a LaTeX error occurs\n\n#                       and writes a bad aux file.  Unlike the regular clean\n\n#                       target, it does not delete other input files, such as\n\n#                       converted images, to save time on the rebuild.\n\n#\n\n#       The dvi target is added to the ALL.  That is, it will be the target\n\n#       built by default.  If the DEFAULT_PDF argument is given, then the\n\n#       pdf target will be the default instead of dvi.  Likewise,\n\n#       DEFAULT_SAFEPDF sets the default target to safepdf.  If NO_DEFAULT\n\n#       is specified, then no target will be added to ALL, which is\n\n#       convenient when including LaTeX documentation with something else.\n\n#\n\n#       If the argument MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES is given, then each of the\n\n#       target names above will be mangled with the <tex_file> name.  This\n\n#       is to make the targets unique if ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT is called for\n\n#       multiple documents.  If the argument USE_INDEX is given, then\n\n#       commands to build an index are made.  If the argument USE_GLOSSARY\n\n#       is given, then commands to build a glossary are made.  If the\n\n#       argument MULTIBIB_NEWCITES is given, then additional bibtex calls\n\n#       are added to the build to support the extra auxiliary files created\n\n#       with the \\newcite command in the multibib package.\n\n#\n\n# History:\n\n#\n\n# 1.10.0 Added NO_DEFAULT and DEFAULT_PS options.\n\n#       Fixed issue with cleaning files for LaTeX documents originating in\n\n#       a subdirectory.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.6 Fixed problem with LATEX_SMALL_IMAGES.\n\n#       Strengthened check to make sure the output directory does not contain\n\n#       the source files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.5 Add support for image types not directly supported by either latex\n\n#       or pdflatex.  (Thanks to Jorge Gerardo Pena Pastor for SVG support.)\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.4 Fix issues with filenames containing multiple periods.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.3 Hide some variables that are now cached but should not show up in\n\n#       the ccmake list of variables.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.2 Changed MACRO declarations to FUNCTION declarations.  The better\n\n#       FUNCTION scoping will hopefully avoid some common but subtle bugs.\n\n#       This implicitly increases the minimum CMake version to 4.6 (although\n\n#       I honestly only test it with the latest 4.8 version).\n\n#\n\n#       Since we are updating the minimum CMake version, I'm going to start\n\n#       using the builtin LIST commands that are now available.\n\n#\n\n#       Favor using pdftops from the Poppler package to convert from pdf to\n\n#       eps.  It does a much better job than ImageMagick or ghostscript.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.1 Fixed typo that caused the LATEX_SMALL_IMAGES option to fail to\n\n#       activate.\n\n#\n\n# 1.9.0 Add support for the multibib package (thanks to Antonio LaTorre).\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.2 Fix corner case when an argument name was also a variable containing\n\n#       the text of an argument.  In this case, the CMake IF was matching\n\n#       the argument text with the contents of the variable with the same\n\n#       argument name.\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.1 Fix problem where ps2pdf was not getting the appropriate arguments.\n\n#\n\n# 1.8.0 Add support for synctex.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.7 Support calling xindy when making glossaries.\n\n#\n\n#       Improved make clean support.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.6 Add support for the nomencl package (thanks to Myles English).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.5 Fix issue with bibfiles being copied two different ways, which causes\n\n#       Problems with dependencies (thanks to Edwin van Leeuwen).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.4 Added the DEFAULT_SAFEPDF option (thanks to Raymond Wan).\n\n#\n\n#       Added warnings when image directories are not found (and were\n\n#       probably not given relative to the source directory).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.3 Fix some issues with interactions between makeglossaries and bibtex\n\n#       (thanks to Mark de Wever).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.2 Use ps2pdf to convert eps to pdf to get around the problem with\n\n#       ImageMagick dropping the bounding box (thanks to Lukasz Lis).\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.1 Fixed some dependency issues.\n\n#\n\n# 1.7.0 Added DEPENDS options (thanks to Theodore Papadopoulo).\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.1 Ported the makeglossaries command to CMake and embedded the port\n\n#       into UseLATEX.cmake.\n\n#\n\n# 1.6.0 Allow the use of the makeglossaries command.  Thanks to Oystein\n\n#       S. Haaland for the patch.\n\n#\n\n# 1.5.0 Allow any type of file in the INPUTS lists, not just tex file\n\n#       (suggested by Eric Noulard).  As a consequence, the ability to\n\n#       specify tex files without the .tex extension is removed.  The removed\n\n#       function is of dubious value anyway.\n\n#\n\n#       When copying input files, skip over any file that exists in the\n\n#       binary directory but does not exist in the source directory with the\n\n#       assumption that these files were added by some other mechanism.  I\n\n#       find this useful when creating large documents with multiple\n\n#       chapters that I want to build separately (for speed) as I work on\n\n#       them.  I use the same boilerplate as the starting point for all\n\n#       and just copy it with different configurations.  This was what the\n\n#       separate ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT method was supposed to originally be for.\n\n#       Since its external use is pretty much deprecated, I removed that\n\n#       documentation.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.1 Copy .sty files along with the other class and package files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.4.0 Added a MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES option that will mangle the target names.\n\n#\n\n#       Fixed problem with copying bib files that became apparent with\n\n#       CMake 2.4.\n\n#\n\n# 1.3.0 Added a LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH variable that allows you or the user to\n\n#       specify where the built latex documents to go.  This is especially\n\n#       handy if you want to do in-source builds.\n\n#\n\n#       Removed the ADD_LATEX_IMAGES macro and absorbed the functionality\n\n#       into ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT.  The old interface was always kind of\n\n#       clunky anyway since you had to specify the image directory in both\n\n#       places.  It also made supporting LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH problematic.\n\n#\n\n#       Added support for jpeg files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.2.0 Changed the configuration options yet again.  Removed the NO_CONFIGURE\n\n#       Replaced it with a CONFIGURE option that lists input files for which\n\n#       configure should be run.\n\n#\n\n#       The pdf target no longer depends on the dvi target.  This allows you\n\n#       to build latex documents that require pdflatex.  Also added an option\n\n#       to make the pdf target the default one.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.1 Added the NO_CONFIGURE option.  The @ character can be used when\n\n#       specifying table column separators.  If two or more are used, then\n\n#       will incorrectly substitute them.\n\n#\n\n# 1.1.0 Added ability include multiple bib files.  Added ability to do copy\n\n#       sub-tex files for multipart tex files.\n\n#\n\n# 1.0.0 If both ps and pdf type images exist, just copy the one that\n\n#       matches the current render mode.  Replaced a bunch of STRING\n\n#       commands with GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT commands that were made to do\n\n#       the desired function.\n\n#\n\n# 0.4.0 First version posted to CMake Wiki.\n\n#\n",
