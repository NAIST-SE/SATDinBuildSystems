How the downloaded\n\n#       and unpacked contents are used is up to the caller, but the motivating case is\n\n#       to download source code which can then be included directly in the build with\n\n#       add_subdirectory() after the call to download_project(). Source and build\n\n#       directories are set up with this in mind.\n\n#\n\n#       The PROJ argument is required. The projectName value will be used to construct\n\n#       the following variables upon exit (obviously replace projectName with its actual\n\n#       value):\n\n#\n\n#           projectName_SOURCE_DIR\n\n#           projectName_BINARY_DIR\n\n#\n\n#       The SOURCE_DIR and BINARY_DIR arguments are optional and would not typically\n\n#       need to be provided. They can be specified if you want the downloaded source\n\n#       and build directories to be located in a specific place. The contents of\n\n#       projectName_SOURCE_DIR and projectName_BINARY_DIR will be populated with the\n\n#       locations used whether you provide SOURCE_DIR/BINARY_DIR or not.\n\n#\n\n#       The DOWNLOAD_DIR argument does not normally need to be set. It controls the\n\n#       location of the temporary CMake build used to perform the download.\n\n#\n\n#       The PREFIX argument can be provided to change the base location of the default\n\n#       values of DOWNLOAD_DIR, SOURCE_DIR and BINARY_DIR. If all of those three arguments\n\n#       are provided, then PREFIX will have no effect. The default value for PREFIX is\n\n#       CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.\n\n#\n\n#       The QUIET option can be given if you do not want to show the output associated\n\n#       with downloading the specified project.\n\n#\n\n#       In addition to the above, any other options are passed through unmodified to\n\n#       ExternalProject_Add() to perform the actual download, patch and update steps.\n\n#       The following ExternalProject_Add() options are explicitly prohibited (they\n\n#       are reserved for use by the download_project() command):\n\n#\n\n#           CONFIGURE_COMMAND\n\n#           BUILD_COMMAND\n\n#           INSTALL_COMMAND\n\n#           TEST_COMMAND\n\n#\n\n#       Only those ExternalProject_Add() arguments which relate to downloading, patching\n\n#       and updating of the project sources are intended to be used. Also note that at\n\n#       least one set of download-related arguments are required.\n\n#\n\n#       If using CMake 3.2 or later, the UPDATE_DISCONNECTED option can be used to\n\n#       prevent a check at the remote end for changes every time CMake is run\n\n#       after the first successful download. See the documentation of the ExternalProject\n\n#       module for more information. It is likely you will want to use this option if it\n\n#       is available to you. Note, however, that the ExternalProject implementation contains\n\n#       bugs which result in incorrect handling of the UPDATE_DISCONNECTED option when\n\n#       using the URL download method or when specifying a SOURCE_DIR with no download\n\n#       method. Fixes for these have been created, the last of which is scheduled for\n\n#       inclusion in CMake 3.8.0. Details can be found here:\n\n#\n\n#           https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/commit/bdca68388bd57f8302d3c1d83d691034b7ffa70c\n\n#           https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16428\n\n#\n\n#       If you experience build errors related to the update step, consider avoiding\n\n#       the use of UPDATE_DISCONNECTED.\n\n#\n\n# EXAMPLE USAGE:\n\n#\n\n#   include(DownloadProject)\n\n#   download_project(PROJ                googletest\n\n#                    GIT_REPOSITORY      https://github.com/google/googletest.git\n\n#                    GIT_TAG             master\n\n#                    UPDATE_DISCONNECTED 1\n\n#                    QUIET\n\n#   )\n\n#\n\n#   add_subdirectory(${googletest_SOURCE_DIR} ${googletest_BINARY_DIR})\n\n#\n\n#========================================================================================\n",
