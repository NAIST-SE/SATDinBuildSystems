You may well\n\n# need to rewrite most of this file, but you shouldn't need to touch the\n\n# included makefiles.\n\n#\n\n# If you find yourself adding support for new targets that could be useful for\n\n# other projects too, you should add these to the original versions of the\n\n# included Makefiles (in eng.git) so that other teams can use them too.\n\n#\n",
