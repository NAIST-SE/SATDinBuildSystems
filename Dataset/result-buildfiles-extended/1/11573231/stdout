If you wish to embed DRAKVUF technology into proprietary   #\n\n# software, alternative licenses can be aquired from the author.          #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# Note that the GPL places important restrictions on \"derivative works\",  #\n\n# yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid   #\n\n# misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   #\n\n# allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        #\n\n# derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   #\n\n# following with any software or content covered by this license          #\n\n# (\"Covered Software\"):                                                   #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Reads or includes copyrighted data files.                             #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    #\n\n# results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will #\n\n# execute anything you tell them to).                                     #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The #\n\n# installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including #\n\n# DRAKVUF with other software in compressed or archival form does not     #\n\n# trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  #\n\n# or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    #\n\n# purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered #\n\n# Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  #\n\n# another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       #\n\n# Internet).                                                              #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  #\n\n# above.                                                                  #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  #\n\n# of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret #\n\n# the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   #\n\n# the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     #\n\n# these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      #\n\n# particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      #\n\n# source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    #\n\n# must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including #\n\n# obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    #\n\n# the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         #\n\n# allowed.  All GPL references to \"this License\", are to be treated as    #\n\n# including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     #\n\n# Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL #\n\n# software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   #\n\n# be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open #\n\n# source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    #\n\n# DRAKVUF or grant special permissions to use it in other open source     #\n\n# software.  Please contact tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com with any such       #\n\n# requests.  Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source     #\n\n# software into Covered Software without special permission from the      #\n\n# copyright holders.                                                      #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     #\n\n# DRAKVUF in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above,         #\n\n# alternative license can be requested from the author to integrate       #\n\n# DRAKVUF into proprietary applications and appliances.  Please email     #\n\n# tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com for further information.                      #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        #\n\n# Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  #\n\n# and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     #\n\n# right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. #\n\n# This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.          #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# Source code also allows you to port DRAKVUF to new platforms, fix bugs, #\n\n# and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to submit your changes #\n\n# on https://github.com/tklengyel/drakvuf, or by other methods.           #\n\n# By sending these changes, it is understood (unless you specify          #\n\n# otherwise) that you are offering unlimited, non-exclusive right to      #\n\n# reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  DRAKVUF will always be          #\n\n# available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to   #\n\n# relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software  #\n\n# projects (such as KDE and NASM).                                        #\n\n# To specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say   #\n\n# so when you send them.                                                  #\n\n#                                                                         #\n\n# This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but     #\n\n# WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of              #\n\n# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
