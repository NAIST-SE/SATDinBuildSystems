Normally, we'd just add\n\n# sizeof_f.f90 to the libmpi_mpif_la_SOURCES and be done with it.\n\n# However, since this is the first *actual Fortran* source that we've\n\n# added to libmpi_mpif_la_SOURCEs, this causes Libtool to use the\n\n# *Fortran* linker to create the final libmpi_mpif.la library\n\n# (vs. using the C linker, as it has done for years).  This exposes an\n\n# unfortunate bug in the Absoft linker: it does not honor the order of\n\n# -Wl arguments, which basically causes the resulting libmpi_mpif.so\n\n# to be borked.\n\n#\n\n# To get around this, we compile sizeof_f.f90 into its own LT\n\n# convenience library, and then we LIBADD that convenience library\n\n# into the main libmpi_mpifh.la.  In this way, we basically trick\n\n# Libtool into still using the C linker to create libmpi_mpif.la, and\n\n# our -Wl flags therefore don't get re-ordered.\n\n#\n\n# All this being said, we can't rely on Automake/Libtool not figuring\n\n# out this workaround indefinitely.  So Jeff advised Absoft to fix\n\n# this bug in Sep 2014.\n",
