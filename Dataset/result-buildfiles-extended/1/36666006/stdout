At this level (in the CLI, and likewise in the NCP) they are\n\n# functionally identical.\n\n#\n\n# ORIGINALLY (historical note about how things are/where built):\n\n#\n\n#     The difference between MTD and FTD was a define..  -DOPENTHREAD_MTD\n\n#     There was no \"FTD\" define, it is/was assumed that FTD is the default.\n\n#\n\n#     Historically this library -DOPENTHREAD_MTD was not defined/set.\n\n#     (it is set via a commandline define in 'lib-openthread')\n\n#\n\n#     Thus, the existing(previous) way *THIS* library was compiled is\n\n#     exactly the FTD path. Meaning the \"cli\" library always sees\n\n#     the FTD varients of various headers/classes.\n\n#\n\n#     The same is true of the \"ncp\" library.\n\n#\n\n# HOWEVER there are two varients of the CLI application, CLI-MTD\n\n# and CLI-FTD (and likewise, two varients of the ncp application)\n\n# These applications link against two different OpenThread libraries.\n\n#\n\n# Which flavor, you get depends upon which library: \"mtd\" or \"ftd\" is linked.\n\n#\n\n# Which on the surface appear to link fine against the MTD/FTD library.\n\n#\n\n# In this description/example we focus on the  \"nework_data_leader\"\n\n# header file. The FTD varient has many private variables, functions\n\n# and other things of \"FTD\" (ie: full) implementation items.\n\n#\n\n# In contrast the MTD is generaly stubbed out with stub-functions\n\n# inlined in the header that return \"error not implemented\" or similar.\n\n#\n\n# Thus it works... here ... With this file and this example.\n\n#\n\n# The unknown:\n\n#    What about the other files?\n\n#    What about the other c++ classes?\n\n#    Is this true always? Is this robust?\n\n#    Or is there a hidden \"got-ya\" that will snag the next person?\n\n#\n\n# This also fails static analisys, checks.\n\n#    Application - with MTD vrs FTD class.\n\n#    Library #1  (cli-lib) with FTD selected.\n\n#    Library #2  (openthread) with two different class flavors.\n\n#\n\n# The static analisys tools will say: \"NOPE\" different classes!\n\n# Perhaps this will change if/when nothing is implemented in the 'mtd-header'\n\n#\n\n# Additionally, tools that perform \"whole program optimization\" will\n\n# throw errors becuase the data structures differ greatly.\n\n#\n\n# Hence, CLI library (and NCP) must exist in two flavors.\n\n#\n\n# Unless and until these libraries do not \"accidently\" suck in\n\n# a \"flavored\" header file somewhere.\n",
