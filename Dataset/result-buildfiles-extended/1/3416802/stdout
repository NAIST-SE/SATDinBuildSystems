This\n\n#    results in messages in stderr saying that these headers\n\n#    were not found. Redirect the stderr output to /dev/null\n\n#    to prevent seeing these messages.\n\n# 2) sed the output to \n\n#    2.1) remove blank lines and lines that begin with \"# \"\n\n#    2.2) When gcc -E is run on the Mac OS  and solaris sparc platforms it\n\n#         introduces a line of output that shows up as a difference between\n\n#         the .pp and .out files. Remove these OS specific preprocessor text\n\n#         inserted by the preprocessor.\n\n# 3) diff the generated file and the canons (.pp files already in\n\n#    the repository).\n\n# 4) delete the .out file that is generated.\n\n#\n\n# If the diff fails, the generated file is not removed.

If\n      the directory does not match the enhanced class' package, the package\n      structure will be created beneath the directory. By default, the\n      enhancer overwrites the original .class file.\n    * -enforcePropertyRestrictions/-epr <true/t | false/f>: Whether to\n      throw an exception when it appears that a property access entity is\n      not obeying the restrictions placed on property access. Defaults to\n      false.\n    * -addDefaultConstructor/-adc <true/t | false/f>: The spec requires\n      that all persistent classes define a no-arg constructor. This flag\n      tells the enhancer whether to add a protected no-arg constructor to\n      any persistent classes that don't already have one. Defaults to true.\n    * -tmpClassLoader/-tcl <true/t | false/f>: Whether to load persistent\n      classes with a temporary class loader. This allows other code to then\n      load the enhanced version of the class within the same JVM. Defaults\n      to true. Try setting this flag to false as a debugging step if you\n      run into class loading problems when running the enhancer.\n\nEach additional argument to the enhancer must be one of the following:\n    * The full name of a class.\n    * The .java file for a class.\n    * The .class file of a class.\n\nIf you do not supply any arguments to the enhancer, it will run on the -\n     - classes in your persistent class list (see Section 1, “Persistent\n     Class List”).\n\nYou can run the enhancer over classes that have already been enhanced, in -\n     - which case it will not further modify the class. You can also run\n     it over classes that are not persistence-capable, in which case it\n     will treat the class as persistence-aware. Persistence-aware classes\n     can directly manipulate the persistent fields of persistence-capable\n     classes.\n\nNote that the enhancement process for subclasses introduces dependencies on -\n     - the persistent parent class being enhanced. This is normally not\n     problematic; however, when running the enhancer multiple times over a\n     subclass whose parent class is not yet enhanced, class loading errors\n     can occur. In the event of a class load error, simply re-compile and\n     re-enhance the offending classes.\n",

These targets are usually executed \n    before and after some main targets. They are: \n\n      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties\n      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties\n      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation\n      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation\n      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file\n      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file\n      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests\n      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test\n      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test\n      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building\n      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building\n      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products\n\n    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)\n\n    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"-post-compile\">\n            <obfuscate>\n                <fileset dir=\"${build.classes.dir}\"/>\n            </obfuscate>\n        </target>\n\n    For list of available properties check the imported \n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n\n    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.\n    The targets of interest are: \n\n      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation\n      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution\n      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging\n      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution\n      -do-jar-with-manifest:    JAR building (if you are using a manifest)\n      -do-jar-without-manifest: JAR building (if you are not using a manifest)\n      run:                      execution of project \n      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation\n      test-report:              JUnit report generation\n\n    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:\n\n        <target name=\"run\" depends=\"NSN-impl.jar\">\n            <exec dir=\"bin\" executable=\"launcher.exe\">\n                <arg file=\"${dist.jar}\"/>\n            </exec>\n        </target>\n\n    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on \n    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available \n    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the\n    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. \n\n    ",
