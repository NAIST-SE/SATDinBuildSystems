The first argument in both modes is\n\n# the name of the Find-module where it is called (in original casing).\n\n#\n\n# The first simple mode looks like this:\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(<name> (DEFAULT_MSG|\"Custom failure message\") <var1>...<varN> )\n\n# If the variables <var1> to <varN> are all valid, then <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND\n\n# will be set to TRUE.\n\n# If DEFAULT_MSG is given as second argument, then the function will generate\n\n# itself useful success and error messages. You can also supply a custom error message\n\n# for the failure case. This is not recommended.\n\n#\n\n# The second mode is more powerful and also supports version checking:\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [REQUIRED_VARS <var1>...<varN>]\n\n#                                           [VERSION_VAR   <versionvar>\n\n#                                           [CONFIG_MODE]\n\n#                                           [FAIL_MESSAGE \"Custom failure message\"] )\n\n#\n\n# As above, if <var1> through <varN> are all valid, <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND\n\n# will be set to TRUE.\n\n# After REQUIRED_VARS the variables which are required for this package are listed.\n\n# Following VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can be specified which holds\n\n# the version of the package which has been found. If this is done, this version\n\n# will be checked against the (potentially) specified required version used\n\n# in the find_package() call. The EXACT keyword is also handled. The default\n\n# messages include information about the required version and the version\n\n# which has been actually found, both if the version is ok or not.\n\n# Use the option CONFIG_MODE if your FindXXX.cmake module is a wrapper for\n\n# a find_package(... NO_MODULE) call, in this case all the information\n\n# provided by the config-mode of find_package() will be evaluated\n\n# automatically.\n\n# Via FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified, if this is not\n\n# used, the default message will be displayed.\n\n#\n\n# Example for mode 1:\n\n#\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(LibXml2  DEFAULT_MSG  LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)\n\n#\n\n# LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARY and\n\n# LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE.\n\n# If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR,\n\n# independent whether QUIET was used or not.\n\n# If it is found, success will be reported, including the content of <var1>.\n\n# On repeated Cmake runs, the same message won't be printed again.\n\n#\n\n# Example for mode 2:\n\n#\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(BISON  REQUIRED_VARS BISON_EXECUTABLE\n\n#                                             VERSION_VAR BISON_VERSION)\n\n# In this case, BISON is considered to be found if the variable(s) listed\n\n# after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e. BISON_EXECUTABLE in this case.\n\n# Also the version of BISON will be checked by using the version contained\n\n# in BISON_VERSION.\n\n# Since no FAIL_MESSAGE is given, the default messages will be printed.\n\n#\n\n# Another example for mode 2:\n\n#\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)\n\n#    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)\n\n# In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to FIND_PACKAGE(Automoc4 NO_MODULE)\n\n# and adds an additional search directory for automoc4.\n\n# The following FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call produces a proper\n\n# success/error message.\n",
