# Research Artifact: Characterizing and Mitigating Self-Admitted Build Debt

https://github.com/NAIST-SE/SATDinBuildSystems

This is a research artifact for the paper: **Characterizing and Mitigating Self-Admitted Build Debt**. This artifact is a repository consisting of our 500 SABD comments dataset and 'ready-to-be-addressed' SABD comments. The purposes of this artifact are to enable researchers to reuse the dataset for further software engineering research.


## Abstract
Technical Debt is a metaphor used to describe the situation in which long-term code quality is traded for short-term goals in software projects.
In recent years, the concept of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) was proposed, which focuses on debt that is intentionally introduced and described by developers.
Although prior work has made important observations about admitted technical debt in source code, little is known about SATD in build systems. 
In this paper, we coin the term Self-Admitted Build Debt (SABD) and 
conduct a qualitative analysis of 500 SABD extracted from the Maven build system of 300 projects.
Our results show that limitations in tools and libraries, and complexities of dependency management are the most frequent causes, accounting for 49% and 23% of the comments.
We also find that developers often document SABD as issues to be fixed later. 
To automate the detection of SATD rationale, we train classifiers to label comments according to the surrounding document content. 
The classifier performance is promising, achieving an F1-score of 0.67--0.75. 
Finally, we were able to identify 43% of the ready-to-be-addressed SABD, with 56% of them being quickly resolved after developers were being made aware.
Our work presents the first step towards understanding technical debt in build systems and opens up avenues for future work such as tool support and awareness for both researchers and build system maintainers.
